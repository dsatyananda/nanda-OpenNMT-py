That was good.
Are you absolutely certain about this?
We've done the best we can.
You're older than Tom.
I'm going to try to go to sleep now.
We spoke on the phone.
I am to meet him there.
"Excuse me, how much is this sweater?"
Thanks so much.
This is what I do for a living.

The meeting lasted two hours.
This dish is tasty.
We walked among the trees.

It's time to get up.
Aren't you sick of eating here?
I can speak English a little.

"I have about 5,000 yen."
Which house did you live in?
I grew up in Boston.
Why do you want Tom to have it?

Have you bought a watermelon?
Why did you give up?

Can I borrow those?
He always tells vulgar jokes.

Do you think you could make it before lunch?
I just ate sushi and drank beer.
My hobby is playing the piano.
The hole is big enough.
Stop following me.
Please drop me off at the station.
We don't have any more bread.
I wish Tom hadn't told Mary about that.
Tom doesn't get invited to parties anymore.
Do they have a computer?

This room gets little sunshine.

How much is this watch?
I'll wait at the bus stop.
"If Tom hadn't helped Mary, she wouldn't have stood a chance of surviving."
Don't tease me.
Tom and Mary have been married for about three years.
I'm looking for a part-time job.
I'm bored.
Maybe Tom doesn't want us to find Mary.
That was a good joke. Tell us another one.
Save me some ice cream.
She looks familiar.

I want mine.
Keep your promises.
Tom likes tea better than coffee.
We've been together for thirty years.
Do you bowl?
It's not my fault.
I don't even know him.
How did dinner go yesterday?
You should stay in bed.
You haven't given me what I asked for.

These shirts are selling like hotcakes.
Tom pulled the door closed and locked it.
Do you know whose this is?

It's hard not to come to this conclusion.
What's for dinner today?

He is a quiet man.
What are the symptoms?
Get up.
Tom had a car accident in Boston.
How much is the rent for this room?
I'll give you an answer in a day or two.
Did you really expect him to tell you the truth?
"Tom looks a bit tired, doesn't he?"
"You made the mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
"You don't want Tom to think you're crazy, do you?"
"Because of some technical problem, a movie was shown in place of the announced program."
This is insufficient.
We talked over the phone.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
I'm ready for tomorrow.
Who is he?
Tom wondered what could have made Mary change her mind.
Do you have any soft drinks?
Are you quite sure?
I don't like chocolate.
"When she was finished ironing, Mary switched off the iron and unplugged it, then left it alone for a while to let it cool."
Where is the train station?
We've made a final decision.
Probably he will come soon.

Come on!

Why didn't you tell her?
We're still searching.
How much is this umbrella?
I'm so happy to be done with that.
He has more books than he can read.
"Tom, I want to show you something."
What have you got?
This is not enough.
Tom remains puzzled.
Half of the worldâ€™s population lives in cities.
What do you have in your bag?
When are you leaving?
Does it snow a lot here in the winter?
Should I stay or should I go?
I'm not ready to die.
Is that so?

Tom quit school.
Everything has been good.
It's upstairs.
Are you off duty tonight?
Allow me to accompany you.

I don't consider him honest.
You have no need to be ashamed.

The rice was still warm.

Where were they?
I want you to reconsider your decision.

He has a sweet voice.
What should I wear?
The sudden increase of cars is causing a large number of traffic accidents every day.
I know where you want to be.
You'd better sit here.

Are you sure?
I want to go with you.

He said he would run 200 kilometers in a day and he did.
What do you want to drink?
"Actually, I've already done that."
This baby is 3 weeks old.

What direction are you going?
How much did you drink last night?

That's all I want to say.
What happens if Tom doesn't pass?
Let's listen to some music.
"See what the problem is, OK?"
Please pay at the register.
I asked her if she knew his address.
Do you feel guilty?
What on earth are you talking about?
Did you find your letters?
It's strange.
My family is a large one.
Tom fixed it.
We are learning Arabic.
The war could not last much longer.
I'm glad I could help.
He began to feel ill.
How much is it?
Apples are sold by the dozen.
Does Tom like to swim?
Is there anything I should know?
You can call me anytime you like.
It's a misunderstanding.
Tom is always complaining about his boss.
It is time to get up.
The road which leads to the hotel is narrow.
Cut it out.
The cake is too sweet.
Tom says he's innocent.
How will it work?
Tom has attempted to escape at least three times.
Let me look into it.
Do you think that really matters to any of us?

It's already seven.
Is your job interesting?
I wouldn't have been able to finish the job without your help.
He easily gets angry.
I've been expecting your call.
Tom suggested ways we could save money.
Everything's so cheap.
Please show me how I have to do it.

I'm your friend.
We've been asking the wrong kind of questions.
We collect stamps from all around the world.
I hurt my eye when my contact slipped out of place.
Are we done yet?
Who are you waiting for?
"Tom saw Mary's name on the list, too."
Tom knows he's in trouble.
What's so hard?
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
May I borrow your dictionary?
My sister is fond of music.
I was absent from the party.
To love life is to love God.
I have some French books.
His advice was very helpful.
We've done it all.
I hope that I can do it.
We agree as well.
You had plenty of time.

Tom thought it was a good solution.

Chill out.

Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office.
Do you like French wines?
Tom isn't the traitor.
It's confidential.
Really?
It's an old picture.
Tom should just resign.
We never forget.
I can't stand it anymore.
All the leaves have fallen.
You'd better not wait here.
I suppose we should tell Tom the truth.
The question is what do we do now.
This room has air conditioning.
Is this your first conference in Paris?
I've just come back.
My house is big.
Tom retired from coaching in 2013.
I know the girl.
She is playing with a doll.
We'll have to do something.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
How I've missed you!
The barn was empty.
Get up out of bed.

It is up to you.
What does this mean?

Let's try it.

She was in the hospital for six weeks because of her illness.
I just got up. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
There's no reason to be afraid.
I need more time to finish my homework.
Tom was very scared.
She greets him every morning as he enters the school building.
I don't see Tom.
Would you like some fruit?
It's been snowing all night.
It doesn't have to end like this.
Tom stirred his coffee with a spoon.
How long were you and Tom together?
"The bill, please."
I hope it stops raining.
Thank you for your interest.
I'll take my car.
You should follow the doctor's advice.
Where've you guys been?
Smoking is harmful to your health.
Look at me.
The kitten was drinking milk under the table.
That's not a cat. That's a dog.
Why should I wait?
Raise both of your arms up like this.
I wanted to get a lot of money.
I'm listening to the radio.
Tom has never lived anywhere except Boston.
How many people are in this room?
I'll go if you will.
It could've been Tom.
How did your date with Tom go?
Have you ever heard anything like that?
Perhaps he missed the train.
You don't have to say anything.
I believe that you will succeed.
It reminds me of someone.
Can I turn on the TV?
Tom has never eaten raw horse meat.
I'll only buy the car if they fix the brakes first.
"No matter how cold it was, he never wore an overcoat."
"Good morning, everybody."
I promise.
The police are after you.
I told Tom a few jokes.
Where will we meet?

Have you finished breakfast yet?
How does it look?
Feed the bird.
"Please give Tom another chance, OK?"
"Could you call a doctor, please?"
Tom picked a lot of flowers.
How do you say that in Italian?
That's it. I've done all I can do.
I'm ready for tomorrow.
How could I not see this coming?
Cook the rice.
Tom said he's no expert.
Tom has lived in Boston for most of his life.
I will be back soon.
I love lasagna.
"Pass me the butter, please."
I often spend my free time listening to music.
I can sing it in English.
The African elephant has bigger ears than the Asian elephant.
Tom is very old.
How are you?
Do you have a driver's license?
This is my sister.
I could be away for some time.
"Hey, Tom, you've gotten a lot taller since I last saw you."
I made it myself.
I have a car that was made in Japan.
Are you with Tom?
Your objection has been noted.
I was in the mountains.
I thought perhaps you could help us.
Where do you want to go?
Tom left school an hour ago.
Tom may talk to Mary if he wants to.
Enjoy your meal!
That wasn't there before.
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow.
Tom looked confused.
I think Mars is beautiful.
Give me back my wallet.
She hopes to become a designer.
Don't disappoint me.
There are a lot of famous old buildings in Kyoto.
Would you mind shutting the door?
My mother has been dead these ten years.
Those are my orders.
You can pick out any book you like.
Tom is unfit for that job.
We have been here for three weeks.
I hope to hear from you.
Where are you going anyway?
I'm going to need help.
I'm not busy anymore.
Scientists are debating his theory about the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
I'm sad.
Are you expecting anyone?
