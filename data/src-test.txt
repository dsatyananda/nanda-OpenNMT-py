All the students in my class are friendly.
Tom seems a little confused.
I didn't expect Tom to be at the meeting.
He suddenly hit on a good idea while he was taking a bath.
Shut up and let me think.
Don't come so early next time.
Tom didn't see the stop sign.
There is a television in this room.
It is best left untouched.
Where're you going?
What does Tom think?
All right. I'll accept your offer.
This is my wife.
"I want coffee, toast, and jelly."
Who does your laundry for you?
I was brought here against my will.
The drinks were served in coconut shells.

I advise you to stop smoking.
He was hit by a car and died instantly.
Why do they come here?

When are you going back to Boston?
Whose umbrella is this?
Where is the train station?
Drop by my office any time.
You should have come earlier.
What method do you use to organize your files?
I get the point.
Maybe she forgot my birthday.
"Waiter, please bring me some water."
It isn't optional.
I have to visit Tom.
"If you had left a little earlier, you would have avoided the heavy traffic."
We should look after our parents.
The train arrived on schedule.
"Excuse me, have you seen Tom?"
"I'm glad that they fixed the heating system, but now it's too hot."
Thank you very much.
The world changes a lot.
The middle aged man was charged with assault.
I'll never forsake you.
This is never going to end.
I've already retired.
I can't bear living alone.
Tom squatted down to put something on the lower shelf.
Tom has been good to us.
What sport do you like best?
Why is Neptune blue?
Mary and Alice often wear the same thing.
Tom really misses his family.
My father helped me with my homework.
I'm glad I could be of service.

I don't know what to say.

I'm eating rice now.

"How do you do that, Tom?"
You must go to bed now.

There's no class today.

That's why I accepted the offer.
The government imposed a new tax on cigarettes.
Get out!
The same thing happens every year.

Do you have any children?
Patience is a rare virtue these days.
He is not a doctor but a teacher.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Did you go to see a doctor?
Do you think so?
At least I wasn't alone.
I saw Tom's face.
Cats can see things even when it's dark.
"If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry."
He must have been sleeping because he didn't answer the telephone.
This is a hazard to your health.
Are you sure that's enough?
I have two cats.
"Could I speak to you for a moment, Tom?"
I'd rather die than leave.
I have no interest in doing this anymore.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

Which shelf is it on?
You can eat whatever you like.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.

This is a fantastic place.
How does Tom feel about that?
Anyone can do it.
What number bus do I take?
A rush-hour traffic jam delayed my arrival by two hours.
May I use your phone?
I'm only three years older than he is.
I want to buy them all.

I want some paper.
I'll let you know the results as soon as I can.

That's the one thing I hadn't thought of.
Who told you that I was sick?
Father is angry with me.
I felt sad for no reason.

I've failed.

This is an ancient law.
I have lived here a long time.
Tom is mentally disturbed.
I prefer modern furniture.

See you next week!

Shall we go home?
Change is good.
Earth is a beautiful planet.
I wanted to go there.

Tom spends way too much time goofing off.
Neither Tom nor Mary has a swimming pool.
Tom enjoys listening to punk rock.
It's for sale.
Tell me why you didn't do what I asked.
This is a serious mistake.
A gun might come in handy.

Keep a copy of that document.
Tom thinks that he knows everything.

Whose plan is it?
Your hair is too long.
We kept on working for hours without eating anything.

These questions can be answered quite simply.
What do you want?
Tom admitted that he had stolen Mary's money.
Thanks a million.
I can't live without him.
Tom persuaded Mary to join our band.
You still have a lot to learn.
Tom won't be mad at us.

I've got three hours to find Tom.
I saw Tom and Mary leave together.
Smoking is forbidden in this area.
Is this your umbrella?
That country has natural resources.
You may use this car.
I have to go to sleep.
The difficult question is why.
Some of us hate it.
Where did you buy that bag?
I wake up every morning before dawn.
Tom probably can't do that.
I am a student at Oxford University.
"After weeks of working flat out on the project, Tom can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel."
I agree.
There's been a lot of rain this summer.
We've done what we could.
Take the road on the right.
There are still people who can't read.
I'm not convinced at all.
What are you going to drink?
He often plays the guitar.
He's sleeping like a baby.
He's my younger brother.
I've never been to Paris.
Have you already started learning French?

I'm quitting my job as a teacher.
Four multiplied by two is eight.
"Tom has been very unlucky, hasn't he?"
The show's about to start.
Tom rushed into the office.
Tom opened up the crate with a crowbar and took out a stick of dynamite.
Tom was fine.
What have you been doing this week?
Did you get a reply?
Are you asleep?
Can you see them?
"This old book is worth 50,000 yen."
Divide this in half.
When did you move to Berlin?
Didn't you and Tom ever do that?
Are you tired?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

How many flights to Boston do you offer a day?
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

There is nothing like summer and ice cream.
This video is boring.
I'm a free man.
I want to leave this place quickly.
I thought we'd never get out of the burning building alive.
I failed.
Tom is not my son.
There is too much furniture in this room.
You were too young.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
They can't stop us.
I simply don't understand this.
Tom is playing outside.
I am pleased with my new house.
"Sooner or later, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself."
How did your interview go?
I think that she's honest.
Tom has difficulty making decisions.
Who is your teacher?
"She's really smart, isn't she?"
Tom and I both like sailing.
Eat something.
Tom still has some time.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
I'll call you back later.
Won't you join our conversation?
Tom read Mary's letter over and over again.
I had to finish the job by the stated date.
Tom found it difficult to make himself understood in French.
We use our feet to walk.
Nobody lives forever.
Tom is home now.
Tom is acting on his own.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
I just want to have fun.
Tom speaks very fast.
Does he know what you did?
I'll take that as a compliment.
I will do anything for you.
I can't wait to die.
We've already done that.
Are you conservative?
She married him.
Where are you staying?
Tom waited for Mary to come home.
I was just joking.
We've already done that.
You'd better go by bus.
He was spreading mulch in the flower beds.
May I see your passport?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
"If it rains, I'll stay at home."
Where's the airport?
Who is Tom?
Tom pleaded with Mary not to leave.
I love your hair.
You don't count.
"Tom, can you slow down a little?"
"If there's a cheap kanji dictionary in Japan, I will buy it."
He was chosen to be a member of the team.
The old couple sat side by side.
Tom married Mary's sister and Mary married Tom's brother.
Go brush your hair.
That's not surprising.
I'm not a tourist.
He must go there tomorrow.
Tom made the right decision after all.
I agree totally.
I'll need at least three days to translate that thesis.
My mother and father aren't home right now.
"As far as I know, Tom has never tried to commit suicide."
You're wearing your sweater inside out.
Tom seemed to be very surprised.
Don't leave the bicycle out in the rain.
This is very cool.
My hands are cold.
Have you eaten dinner?
Do you eat spaghetti by twirling it around your fork?
I became a lawyer to help people.
We know Tom will do whatever we tell him to do.
A dog followed me to my school.
Did you know Tom worked there?
Which team is winning?
I'm still the boss here.
I am glad to meet you.
Who are these people?
Tom ran out into the street.
Are you attempting to bribe me?
I saw you in my dream.
Show it to me.
Mary's stew was so delicious that Tom had a second helping.
Mary decided never to see him any more.
She whispered something to him.
Have you already eaten dinner?
Tom pretended not to be listening.
I'm not joking.
Is this true?
He was too drunk to drive home.
I had to get back home.
I've lost my fountain pen. I have to buy one tomorrow.
I have no money with me.
You don't have to answer those questions.
I don't know for certain.
She didn't tell me her name.
Didn't you notice us going out of the room?
This happened prior to receiving your letter.
My birthday is coming soon.
The boy knocked the glass over.
Could you turn down the radio?
Does Tom work here?
I'm tired of it.
He should have come.
Where is the nearest bank?
Would you mind shutting the door?
You and I are good friends.
I just don't have much time.
My ears are ringing.
Memorize this poem.
Tom is obsessed with trains.
Why don't you ever wash the dishes?
I'll be better tomorrow.
Tom is the newest member of our team.
"You aren't busy now, are you?"
How does Tom know about that?
Do you guys want something to eat?
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
Tom is a bit pale.
May I take your picture?
I can't decide what to eat for lunch.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
Tom doesn't like cheese.
It's been a long time since I visited my grandmother.
Tom is Mary's uncle.
Tom seems to be sympathetic.
It's already seven.
What kind of music do you want at your wedding?
One must do one's best in everything.
"How do you feel about this, Tom?"
He had the nerve to ask me to marry him.
When will you come home?
I received your letter yesterday.
What caused the power outage?
She's pregnant with twins.
Tom is finishing his work.
I don't suppose you'd still have last Saturday's paper?
Tom appears stunned.
Blow out all the candles on the birthday cake at once.
Finding work is difficult.
I'm hungry.
I barely have enough money for groceries.
There was a traffic accident in front of the house yesterday.
Tom is the only one who didn't pass the test.
Please don't let this happen again.
Are you talking to me?
Tom is a convicted felon.
I don't like your attitude.
How did your date go with Tom?
"In Japan, it's now 3:00 a.m."
He will be a doctor when he grows up.
Do you have an English dictionary?
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
I have a new red car.
Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
Things have changed.
Tom went to school with my son.

Let's talk about your work.
You're not ready yet.
How many French words do you know?
I'm writing a song in French.
Both of his parents are well.
We found the front door locked.
Please give me your permanent address.
The meeting took place yesterday.

How did you get injured?
"Yeah. I think so, too."
That book is available in only one store.
What would you like to drink?
When was the last time you fed the cows?
What's wrong with you?
Every part of the island has been explored.
Tom and Mary played ping pong.
Stop!
My daughter likes egg yolks.
Do you have a similar saying in Japanese?
We have breakfast at seven.
Tom practiced every day at home.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Tom was completely worn out.
We make decisions together.
I'd like to stick around a little longer to see what happens.
Tom has never seen Mary dance.
He set out for Canada yesterday.
Tom solved all the problems.
We go abroad every summer.
The blood test is normal.
The birds flapped their wings.
Tom died three weeks after the accident.
Do you know the difference?
I want to examine you again tomorrow.
It's a good question.
I thought you didn't care about money.
We need rules.
It was really nice.
I'm satisfied.
Tom died from lack of oxygen.
We don't want to lose our credibility.
Tell me what to do.
How long does it take?
Is hitchhiking prohibited in Australia?
We should tell children how to protect themselves.
Tom is a high school student.
Tom's signature is illegible.
"Between you and me, I think our boss is stupid."
You don't need to panic.
Tom looks like he's seen a ghost.
Tom was worn out.
Does Tom know how much you paid for that?
Is there a difference?
Where are you bound?
Tom scolded his son for being late.
I'll accompany you.
We could just leave it here.
Show me that.
I also like cake.
I'm afraid Tom might get hurt.
Tom saw Mary getting ready to leave.
I wouldn't do that that way if I were Tom.
Tom never even said goodbye.
Tom never told anybody about what happened.
Let me see it.
Tom is ignoring you.
This is nonsense.
I wish you a happy birthday.
I didn't order rice.
I have no time.
"To the best of my knowledge, the rumor is not true."
This is strange.
The teacher assembled the students in the hall.
Tom picked up John's briefcase and handed it to him.
Tom asked Mary to teach him how to do the waltz.
This is my younger sister.
"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the bus stop?"
This is surprising.
I don't think we have enough time.
We can't compete with Asia.
Tom is a college student.
What time are you coming?
I liked what you said at the meeting.
When do you want to go?
I hear that he sold his house.
I think that Japan is a very safe country.
Did you tell Tom Mary did this?
I'm a man.
The roof of my house is red.
We don't really have to sell it.
Tom started to sing.
Everybody was silent.
You should help your friends.
Write your address here.
I always said Tom was a smart kid.
When did you come in?
When will you return?
How late is it?
Tom tried to commit suicide.
Don't be scared.
Walking in the moonlight is a romantic way to end a date.
"I don't think the gun is loaded, but you should still be very careful."
Which credit cards can I use?
How long does it take?
I don't want to speak ill of the dead.
Do you have a bicycle?
This is absurd.
She died yesterday afternoon.
Tom flushed the toilet.
I want to die soon.
It's just a matter of time.
I make it a rule not to stay up late.
Tom is stuttering.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
The rules have changed.
"Tom is really drunk, isn't he?"
Even Tom was surprised to hear that.
I must get the book back from him.
I'm starving.
Nothing ever makes him angry.
You must be Tom and Mary.
Please wait in the waiting room.
"So you give up, right?"
Where is my newspaper?
Tom couldn't find the bus stop.
I know you won't do it.
"Tom looks sleepy, doesn't he?"
I'm scared of cats.
Let's do it right now.
Tom should've arrived by this time.
Do you want to come along?
"Hello, how are you?"
"Odd, isn't it? We should have already arrived."
They speak English in New Zealand.
Where's Tom today?
Tom is eating rice.
Our school is across the river.
Tom joined his high school's debate team.
Can I take your word for it?
Most students are tired of having to take examinations all the time.
I fell asleep while watching TV.
You're really a hard worker.
Many roads are flooded. As a result there are long delays.
Closer examination revealed that the skull had been crushed by some heavy blow.
Tom looks bad.
I bought Tom a book.
Don't make fun of other people.
I am afraid that he might get hurt.
Let's start working.
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
I changed my mind about dinner. I'm not really hungry right now.
I'm really hungry.
You are in my way.
He promised he would tell us.
I don't remember Tom's last name.
What time does school begin?
I want to ask you something.
Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
"If it hadn't been for the storm, we would have been in time."
Can we come with you?
Who contributed?
"She has 2,000 books."
She is afraid of cats.
I have read this book before.
How did you like the party?
Get out of bed!
I hope this is the right one.
I'm just kidding.
I want to find out if Tom was at school today.
Tom now lives with his dad.
Stop dreaming.
Tom likes the same kind of stuff that Mary likes.
Tom looks as though he's seen a ghost.
The lock is broken.
Where do you come from?
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary's plan.
I didn't study at all yesterday.
Where are your boots?
The teacher didn't mind explaining the problem again.
Where did you try them?
Double the dose.
Tom and Mary seem fine.
I have a house.
Tom was lying to you.
He is often absent from school.
Tom looked like he was happy.
He is my brother.
You look as healthy as ever.
I had to keep my secret.
I don't have any problem with that.
"Every time they meet, they quarrel."
It's weird.
How many books can I take out at one time?
Please don't cry again.
I need to go to the toilet.
You've made my day.
"If I were you, I would go home and take a good rest."
How's it going with you and Tom?
Tom thanked me for the gift.
I lost my bearings when I came out of the subway.
I need Tom to do a couple of things for me.
I'm not a doctor.
Your chair is identical to mine.
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
It kept raining all day long.
He ran into debt.
Tom will have no choice.
You don't need to go unless you want to.
"Had they left a little earlier, they would have avoided the traffic jam."
There wasn't a single picture on the wall.
I've just finished breakfast.
Should I buy something?
We have many goals.
What did I do?
"Like father, like son."
The house is haunted.
Tom looks nonplussed.
"To make matter worse, the traffic was bad."
I've just finished breakfast.
I'm completely exhausted.
May I ask a question?
The apples are big.
I think I know why Tom isn't here.
It's not a competition.
"I want to tell you something, but it's a secret. Promise not to tell."
I'm a college student.
The sky became darker and darker.
Is it true you can speak French?
I would like an apple.
You dropped your handkerchief.
How much food do you need?
"You have wanted to go there for a long time, haven't you?"
We captured Tom.
Let's go surfing.
I would like to have a cup of coffee.
Is this water okay to drink?
I didn't know that you were going to ask Tom to do that.
I'm tied up with this job recently.
When was the last time you used a ruler?
You're thirty minutes early.
Many of the things Pizzaro had heard about the Inca treasure were true.
I will miss you all.
That's my brother.
Tom knew that Mary needed to buy a car.
I don't think you understand.
Tom likes to listen to classical music.
I have a few theories.
I love this town.
It's a beautiful country.
Tom says the same thing.
The deer was killed by hunters.
Wait and see.
Nothing happened.
What prevented you from coming earlier?
Is this word in common use?
This girl is driving me crazy.
What time do you start check-in?
Tom stutters.
Can I bring Tom?
Where are you going?
I need some paper.
This room can hold three hundred people.
Nobody is perfect.
How much does it cost?
Our company employs over three hundred people.
Tom helped a lot.
I don't want to see you.
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
I'm waiting for him.
She opens the window.
They went by subway.
When did you start?
Tom isn't used to living in the city.
He's standing on his head.
Have you finished your lunch yet?
I'm very hungry.
Didn't you see anything?
We run every day.
He is busy writing a letter.
I'm going over to Tom's tonight.
"If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry."
There's nothing in this drawer.
Don't you think it's risky?
Tom is much more relaxed when Mary isn't around.
You need to be more careful.
I am pleased with myself.
It looks like there's an elevator over there.
What is going on?
"I'm just looking, thank you."
Tom is thirteen years old.
I cleared the table.
We should obey our parents.
We have one of your friends here with us.
He got a lot of money.
What do I need to know?
You may not smoke in this room.
This is the same wallet as I lost a week ago.
Please fix this.
Tom opened the gate for Mary.
Your plan seems better than mine.
I arrived at Narita the day before yesterday.
Tom has passed out.
He is still not back from the mountains.
It was a great privilege working with you.
Tom doesn't think this is such a good idea.
Tom is in the car.
Look at Tom.
It was kind of funny.
You should concentrate on the road when you're driving.
This rose is very beautiful.
He can't be hungry. He's just had lunch.
Don't ask me.
I'll never forget.
"Where there is smoke, there is fire."
Nobody knows why he turns down my help.
I have been abroad several times this year.
Can any of you suggest another solution?
How about eating out with me?
We just met Tom.
I am a college student.
He was caught by the police.
Tom is extremely shy.
"Have you seen my cell phone? ""It's on the table."""
I think you're right.
You could have done it.
This should be washed.
I've always wanted to meet you.
What happened in 2013?
Tell your mother about the trip.
I'll send it back.
Why are they leaving?
Tom has a very thick accent.
The boy is jumping.
Please answer in French.
Who is the team's coach?
Music is the universal language.
Tom said that he had to work on Monday.
You should see a doctor.
Tom is no longer afraid.
Tom says he can wait a long time.
Can you see?
It's not my problem.
I already think you're crazy.
I won't be silent.
Tom has a decent salary.
I bought a pair of shoes.
Where is the bus terminal?
The suspect is a caucasian female.
You know what they say about Tom.
I play in a band.
You have a lot of nerve!
I'm pretty impressed with Tom's progress.
I want to look like her.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
He has an uncontrollable temper.
It was love at first sight.
Cats can see in the dark.
Tom was the one who planted the roses in our garden.
"The rain just stopped, so let's leave."
Raise both of your arms up like this.
The supermarket opens at ten o'clock.
Can you speak English?
My dog likes you.
Tom picked up the phone and dialed.
You should buy yourself something to eat.
We've been trying.
When will you come back home?
Tom is a Red Sox fan.
"Thanks to a cold summer, beer has sold poorly."
Can you eat raw oysters?
How do you do?
You've got to apologize.
"I need some paper, pencils, ink and so on."
I'm fed up with everything and everybody.
"Excuse me, I'm coming through."
Photography is an expensive hobby.
Tom wants to go to Japan.
He suggested that I write to her at once.
Are you being serious?
His room's a mess.
I don't like his smart way of talking.
Let's wait until it stops raining.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
It looked cheap.
Tom has a pretty wife.
Tom was confused by the question.
"If Tom were older, he'd understand."
I've been waiting since six o'clock and still my turn hasn't come.
Any student can answer that question.
What exactly do you know about Tom?
Who told you to go home?
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
Your wife is mad at you.
There are many mysteries in life.
I've caught a bad cold.
I know Tom isn't guilty.
I'm convinced that Tom isn't telling us everything.
I see.
I want to be as tall as Tom.
I like your optimism.
How long have you been wearing contacts?
"How long will you be away, Tom?"
I've got a plane to catch.
My little brother is watching TV.
Tom kept eating.
I don't think you're crazy.
I don't want to be disturbed until ten.
"I did so, not because I wanted to, but because I had to."
He is eager to become famous.
He did not have much time to work on his speech.
Tom received a letter from Mary.
It's important to read books.
How is the weather today?
Something happened.
I haven't slept well recently.
That doesn't seem too difficult.
I know how much you meant to Tom.
When are you going home?
Now isn't a very good time.
Get me an extra blanket.
They're attempting to contact her.
What do you want to do?
I'll be free all day tomorrow.
Tom thinks you're lying.
He apologized for having offended her.
I think Tom and Mary have fallen in love with each other.
I don't see how you can ignore this.
I couldn't sleep well because it was noisy outside.
Would you prefer to go to the zoo or go to a movie?
Don't pull my leg!
Tom blew his top when he heard that Mary had gone out with John.
That's a joke.
Don't get drunk.
It seemed like a dream to me.
Good job!
It is my cat.
Tom is always telling Mary that he loves her.
These are gifts for my friends.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
Your time is up.
His daughter is a nurse.
I am sure of his passing the exam.
Tom was late for dinner.
I think you and he wanna be alone.
How many people died?
What have you done this week?
Do you remember Tom's telephone number?
Tom wants to meet with me.
"You have to do it, whether you like it or not."
Don't you have a bicycle?
I interpreted their silence as consent.
She wouldn't be happy with him.
You disappointed me.
They forgot to lock the door.
I love the taste of watermelon.
I don't want that anymore.
Everything is great.
I did it like this.
You've dropped your pen.
You drink too much coffee.
They suggested to him that he go alone.
What time does it open?
We won the battle.
I used to go to the beach every summer when I was a kid.
I thought you might want to see Tom.
I saw Tom in the hall.
Tom was looking for help.
Tom knows a lot about music.
I need to go get my laptop.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
How long will you stay here?
"He can't run his own family, let alone a nation!"
She is eight months pregnant.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
I don't need it anymore.
Tom may have known the answer.
Tom doesn't know me.
Why don't we hide in the basement?
Tom is interested in mathematics.
Why did you do it?
I'll give you anything but this.
Tom has a secret admirer.
Both Tom and Mary are from Boston.
Bring me a dry towel.
He has a bicycle.
This isn't my key.
I guess the laundry isn't getting done tonight.
It was in this room that we had the meeting last Friday.
Tom may change his mind later.
Tom put down his glass.
Are you guys sure about this?
I love you.
I'm used to getting up early.
What color are Tom's eyes?
He was cheating.
Tom came by this morning.
Please show me the scar.
Tom is good at cooking.
Where did he go?
Tom had his reasons for staying in Boston.
I won't eat it.
"Tom is disagreeable, isn't he?"
"You shouldn't be alone, Tom."
Tom never would've dated someone like Mary.
We're trying.
He is a handsome young man.
Who's Tom?
This is a movie for men.
"My name's Tom, too."
He's too smart to do something that stupid.
He crossed the street.
Here is our answer to your fax message dated April 1st.
Tom is always healthy.
The fog was so thick that I couldn't see where I was going.
Staying at home is not a pleasant thing.
Can I use your pencil?
Tom went birdwatching.
I thought Tom had gotten over Mary.
Tom is playing the violin now.
Where have you been?
We had a lot of furniture.
Where did you get the hat?
There is a cat.
Hi. How are you doing?
Do you believe in evolution?
Mail service in that country is not quick.
I'll buy you whatever clothes you want.
Tom works with my father.
Tom says he's trying to quit smoking.
"Tom didn't want to come here, but he came anyway."
Move over.
Show me.
He hid his sadness behind a smile.
You're completely right.
It is out of the question.
I'm not used to treatment like that.
"If you're tired, you should go to bed."
Should I help you?
I thought you could help me.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I go to bed about ten.
Are you for real?
He is a doctor.
You look very tired.
Finding work is difficult.
Maybe what you said is true.
Tom and I used to work together in Boston.
Do you have a non-smoking section?
Tom promised me he'd do it.
Shut up!
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
I think you should sit.
Tom never left the house.
I'm not sure how I can help you.
I'll go to a museum today.
I don't want to live with you.
I was able to do it with a little help from Tom.
Where was he going?
The train flipped over.
I did it with my eyes closed.
How much do you charge per hour?
I swim once a week.
Anyone can do that.
My father is frank.
Tom has lots of acquaintances but very few friends.
Leave me in peace!
"I'm in trouble, aren't I?"
They were all busy.
Enjoy your meal.
Tom doesn't seem to be having any problems.
He shook hands with his friend.
I'm telling you the truth.
There is a shopping area nearby.
The gate is closed at eight.
What's your occupation?
This is my younger sister.
I had to work on an essay.
When will you leave?
I'm no longer afraid of dogs.
How was your vacation?
I hadn't bargained on such a heavy traffic jam.
I'm not sure what else I need to do.
That man is wearing two earrings.
I missed my train.
What do you have?
Everyone has faults.
My battery is running out.
Tom never saw Mary again.
A minute has sixty seconds.
"Take a seat, please."
"You know everything I do, Tom."
Do you need a hand?
I know what Tom saw.
Tom doesn't have a car.
Tom is waiting for Mary now.
Mary has not started yet.
His speech made a deep impression on the students.
I'm coming over to your place.
You'll save yourself a lot of time if you take the car.
She tends to be late for school.
A cat came out from under the desk.
Tom and Mary have recently moved to Boston.
I like to eat watermelon.
Tom isn't very muscular.
I often help Tom do that.
Please repair this.
Step on it!
He comes back from Sydney today.
Did they fire you?
The recession caused many businesses to close.
Tom isn't watching TV now.
He likes tigers.
"Where there's a will, there's a way."

Isn't that what needs to be done?
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
Naples is a picturesque city.
Tom speaks relatively fast.
Tom may have been injured.
I have a home.
I was caught in a shower.
The bus rattled as it drove along the bumpy road.
Would you explain it in more detail?
They accomplished nothing.
I am living the good life.
She set it aside for future use.
"Turn on the light, please."
Tom crossed the street.
Do you live here?
I've had enough.
Have we met before?
I said I'd talk to Tom about it.
"Tom didn't like the look of his nose, so he had a nose job."
Where is my pen?
Tom closed the book.
I just can't stand this hot weather anymore.
I don't want to die yet.
Show me.
You are absolutely right.
I have only just begun.
I'm afraid it's going to rain.
No one is to leave without permission.
Tom doesn't think Mary wants to go.
Hi! How are you?
I'll need help.
I don't love her anymore.
"When all the group members are silent, somebody must break the ice."
You must stay awake.
I'm not a journalist.
Can you print that out for me?
I'm glad you liked it.
Did you have fun?
Did Tom know what to do?
Close the door when you leave.
He's always looking at you. He must love you.
"I tried to call you last night, but you didn't answer."
Tom needs guidance.
He is very sensitive to criticism.
When did you realize that?
Leave me alone now.
I'm going to take full responsibility.
What time do you get off?
Say goodbye.
My first French teacher's name was Tom Jackson.
Come back now.

Tom is very funny.
Please call me a doctor.
What color car did you buy?
What's your friend's name?
This is what Tom does for a living.
Wow!
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
Give me something to drink.
How dare you talk to me like that!
I'm getting sick of this.
Tom is leaving in three days.
How about something cold to drink?
Tom gave me a pen.
The bank is three blocks away.
Let your hair down a little.
I didn't say this was heaven.
Tom is bigger than me.
You must conform to the rules.
Why do you need it?
He was very good at playing tennis.
How many languages can you speak?
"Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, was an ophthalmologist."
Tom picked up a rock and threw it at Mary.
Free advice isn't always good advice.
It is more than I can stand.

Do you know the reason?
Let's do it.
Is this your bicycle?
Why were you late this morning?
Please turn off the radio.
Which air conditioner do you think is the most efficient?
You should obey the traffic laws when you drive.
How would I know?

This is a post office and that is a bank.
Tom was murdered by Mary.
He urged us to obey the rule.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
Tom managed to swim across the river.
My pulse is fast.
Set Tom free.
I've got to study.
Everything's really cheap.
When are you coming home?
Tom has another problem.
Let me congratulate you on your engagement.
That's my line.
These are all I have.
I usually get up at six.
He is still not accustomed to city life.
Tom's proposal wasn't acceptable.
He's eating an apple.
"Unless it rains, I will go, too."
China is much bigger than Japan.
You tore your pants.
We don't know our neighbors.
I just wanted to tell you I love you.
Do you want to play tennis with us?
The children are making a lot of noise.
This is a true story.
She is very sensitive to criticism.
I worry about him.
You look unsure.

I'm not a student.
We didn't actually see the accident.
Tom is having lunch.
Tom hasn't slept at all since the day before yesterday.
I told Tom I thought it was a good idea.
One is red and the other is white.
Please go get help.
Why do you say that?
Not all of the staff was present.
My brother is very tall.
"When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs."
I'd like to see her.
Parents are usually very wise.
This sentence contains several mistakes.
Tom could do nothing to help Mary.
I know where Tom keeps his important papers.
"The population of the city is about 100,000."
What time will the game start?
I thought I told you to clean your room.
Maybe Tom would like that.
Prices are about to go up again.
Please just tell me what's going on.
We can't sleep because of the noise.
It's a pity that you can't join us.
My legs still hurt.
What do you usually do on Sundays?
Does Tom know what to do with this?
I just finished breakfast.
He's a DJ.
She is seldom late for school.
Are you hungry?
Do you want anything to eat?
Do you know what's happening?
Did you sleep well?
I should've told Tom earlier.
God bless you!
We were directly in the path of the storm.
"Whatever you may say, you won't be believed."
Tom isn't as good a golfer as he says he is.
I like both dogs and cats.
I have a twin sister.
Don't underestimate my power.

Parking and admission are free.
I think I may have to get a loan.
I think I'm going to faint.
We didn't learn a thing.
Tom hasn't had a fight with anybody lately.
I don't have a phone book.
I'd like to rent a car.
There are hardly any books in this room.
"You may not remember me, but I remember you."
Tom opened the door for Mary.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
She blushed.
He acknowledged his fault.
I'm not used to the job yet.
What's a UFO?
I want to know what that is.
She advises me on technical matters.
Where are you going?
What's happening to you?
He has a good brain.
Don't you feel cold?
I have absolute trust in you.
I want this garbage out of here.
I tell you the truth.
The muddy road has ruined my new shoes.
Tom seldom speaks to us anymore.
I'm about your age.
Lots of religious songs in Ladino are translations from Hebrew.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
That'll never change.
I don't often eat out.
Tom left Boston a few days ago.
The meeting started at ten.
Tom stood up and walked out of the room.
I'm not giving you any more money.
I like that purple shirt.
He seems sick.
Do you have a light beer?
Tom was unable to hide his excitement.
I'll be going with you.
Why are you in your pajamas?
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
It rained hard all day.
I can't go until he comes.
I know what this means.
He's eating lunch now.
I can't stand this hot weather.
This is puzzling.
Your shoes are untied.
Where is the toilet?
Hang your coat on the hook.
I took your umbrella by mistake.
I often have nightmares.
Tom is not my son.
He is the image of his father.
Tom has lost hope.
I just wanted to check to see if you're OK.
You are always complaining about your husband.
Tom used to smoke.
What is pottery?
Who will take care of the baby?
Other people's expectations affect how we behave.
Mary is weaving a carpet.
This train runs between Tokyo and Osaka.
I didn't think we needed to wait for Tom.
Go back to your seat.
I don't think that's true.
Are you sure?
He went deer hunting.
I plan to go to bed as soon as all these people go home.
The procedure must be executed correctly and completely.
These hats are the same size.
Some people think eating at home is better for you than eating out.
Some people never grow up.
I need to study.
What's wrong with you?
He's the last man that I want to see.
The customs officials examined the boxes.
She allegedly killed him in self-defense.
How many children do you have?
The rain lasted a week.
I mean it.
I've been very busy.
We ate a very delicious pie.
Where does she want to go?
Tom continued speaking.
The waves are high.
Yesterday was Monday.
I have a half brother.
I think he is sick.
What you do is more important than what you say.
I'm looking for another job.
Tom wanted to be famous.
Those are nice gloves you have on.
That house is big.
I have to know for sure.
We were really moved by his lecture.
It's unclear if they love each other or not.
I want you to read this book.
Are you vegetarian?
Where are your boots?
"The more you study, the more you know."
You speak fluent English.
Why are you holding my hands?
Is this water drinkable?
Old people are usually very wise.
Tom is mowing his front lawn.
"I spoke to the boy, who seemed to be older than the girl."
Leave it to me.
It was a lie.
That doesn't sound too difficult.
We cultivate rice.
"I'd like to go, too."
What do you want to drink?
What's this called?
Tom doesn't feel like studying.
I'm not ready to die yet.
This novel is difficult to understand.
He feels a lot better today.
