I met Tom just the other day in front of the station.
This bucket leaks.

He is trying to quit smoking.
I wonder what Tom is doing now.
I hope I haven't interrupted you.
Nobody came to help him.
I felt the house shake.
It is a pity that he died so young.
Tom has agreed to do what we asked.
The colony declared independence.
I forgot to close the door.
Tom understands what needs to be done.
Tom wanted save up enough money to buy a car.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Where've you been?
Tom bought two chocolate cupcakes with vanilla icing and gave one of them to Mary.
Tom is a thirteen-year-old boy.
This baby is 3 weeks old.
Tom might be seriously ill.
I think you've been trying to contact us.
I'll stick with Tom.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
The interview is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Are you sleeping?
This is not expensive.
I wasn't expecting that to happen.
We have no more rice.
Tom now knows Mary wasn't kidding.
We prepared for an attack.
Have you eaten dinner?
How much money do you want?
I think that ghosts exist.
I'll come by later.
I can't raise my right arm.
I just bought a new laptop.
I want more information.
They didn't find the bomb.
I'm going to church.
I saw her wash the car.
There is no easy road to learning.
I saw you driving by my house this morning.
You can have anything you want.
The food and service are excellent.
"Once a month, I go to the hairdresser."
You've done a perfect job.
Do you really mean that?
I have a stomachache.
I do not trust him any longer.
The train came on time.
I went skiing with Tom.
Tom abandoned them.
I have a serious skin problem.
Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.
Mary is a lovely girl.
Can you keep a secret?
There's not enough coffee.
I do understand.
Will you stay here for a while?
I hate dancing.
Are you a vegetarian?
You'll feel better after a night's sleep.
I had a bad cold.
Tom loves science fiction.
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night.
Thank you for giving me this.
I am not thirsty.
I think I can help Tom with his homework.
I'm just trying to help you out.
I met him yesterday.
"Two for the lunch buffet, please."
Tom was fired.
That salesman looks pretty smart.
My name is known by everyone in our town.
He tried to sleep on the floor.
We never work on Sunday.
Tom has lied to you.
Why can't we go visit Tom?
I will be sixteen in May.
What did you think of the party?
Be alert when you cross a busy street!
How often do you go abroad?
I said that as a joke.
May I ask a favor of you?
I just told Tom the truth.
Production of rice has decreased.
You look very charming today.
It was no trouble.
Did you see anything?
Someone broke into my apartment last night.
I don't agree with him.
Tom sent you something.
The local coffee shop was replaced by a Starbucks.
Seriously?
I haven't been sleeping very well.
Don't play in this room.
The rice is still warm.
I don't think Tom cared.
Tom is wearing gloves.
We know him.
There was almost nothing in the room.
Are you going to school by bus?
It's a privilege to meet you.
I'm looking for a part-time job.
Tom told me he thought I was wasting my time.
We've run short of money.
She poured boiling water into the cup.
Tom keeps bringing that up.
We'll leave as soon as it quits raining.
Thank you kindly.
Tom looked at Mary.
What time is it there now?
She shaved her armpits.
I don't know why that happened.
I use Twitter.
I'll phone you.
Do you want to try it on?
This is how to cook rice.
It's already started to rain.
Hold the rope.
She left her gloves in the car.
I think it would be good for all of us.
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Tom made good use of the money we lent him.
I think I've got it.
"Tom is careless, isn't he?"
How many hours of sleep do you need?
You never mentioned that to me.
Who am I talking with?
Are you spending Thanksgiving with Tom?
I just don't know what to say.
Who is your favorite author?
Who do you think you are?
I must see it.
What you're eating isn't healthy.
They did not like the way he gave orders to everyone.
The ball rolled across the road.
You must follow school rules.
Will you open the door?
Tom is a good worker.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.
It's going to rain soon.
What you are saying does not make sense.
This program has both downloading and uploading capabilities.
Air is to man what water is to fish.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I don't want to pressure you.
Can I help you?
"I didn't want the baby to catch a cold, so I closed the window."
He's my younger brother.
I remember this place.
Tell me everything.
How long will you be gone?
"If a person has not had a chance to acquire his target language by the time he's an adult, he's unlikely to be able to reach native speaker level in that language."
"Are you feeling all right now, Tom?"
He's attracted to black women.
The workers were proud of their work.
Please give me something to drink.
I'm not dumb.
What'll you have to drink?
Bring me today's paper.
I don't like all of them.
I spend too much time in front of my computer.
This is the third longest river in the world.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
What do you have in your pocket?
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
I've been asked to forward this message to you.
Not all birds can fly.
What's your problem?
I'm sick of conferences these days.
There are more women than men in the world.
How could I know?
They have plenty of money.
It took a lot of time and money to build the machine.
What do you want to drink?
The experiment was successful.
Anything else?
That doll is scary.
You don't need to answer that question.
She will be seventeen years old next February.
I stayed indoors because it rained.
Have you ever been to America?
Would you mind shutting the door?
When was your first love?
I sometimes stutter.
Tom is a good employee.
I know what I feel.
This is so sad.
I don't know what I'll do.
Could you please repeat it once again?
I succeeded because of his advice.
Tell me more about what happened.
Stop that.
This is too hard a problem for me to solve.
You don't look like Tom.
I suggest you have a talk with Tom.
Tom is more intelligent than I am.
It wasn't my fault.
Let's leave the problem until tomorrow.
I pushed Tom into the water.
Do you have one?
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
Tom seems bewildered.
I think my suitcase was stolen.
Call 1-800-828-6322 for a free brochure.
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
I'd like to show this picture of Tom to you.
I trust him.
We're very lucky to be alive.
What's with Tom?
What if I fail?
I'll never forsake you.
The tire factory employs 250 people.
"Lovely sunset, isn't it?"
I've climbed Mt. Fuji twice.
Perhaps Tom is in Australia.
Tom may not have enough money to buy what he needs.
I just assumed that Mary was Tom's girlfriend.
The company will advertise its new product on television.
I still want to be here.
Tom knows Mary is hiding something.
Tom said he'd never speak to me again.
When was it built?
I'll return home tomorrow.
Is this camera for sale?
This room is large enough.
Tom must've worked very hard.
You are a good cook.
There are still people who cannot read.
How can I write faster?
You look very pale.
Do you feel guilty?
"The couple separated, never to see each other again."
He is still alive.
So what are you suggesting?
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
He is lazy.
Thanks.
You did what you had to do.
Do you know kabuki?
That was fast.
I'll make you a new suit.
Why didn't you say something?
Would you put those bags in the car?
I had to go back home.
Tom explained it to me.
He is still angry.
The teacher pointed out several mistakes in my English composition.
Tom closed his eyes.
They don't talk to me anymore.
What do you want?
My rifle's empty.
I thought Tom would say hello to Mary.
I used to dream about being a millionaire.
I heard you lost your job.
I can't remember his name.
Is that about right?
Are you certain?
I'm probably going to be busy soon.
You must return the book by the end of April.
Most Englishmen are conservative.
Have you washed the car yet?
I don't know either.
Who invited you guys?
Happy birthday!
I'm going to be out today.
We have more customers than we can count.
"When we are asleep, bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls."
Now give me what I want.
Control yourself.
People don't say that anymore.
Tom slowly looked around the room.
I'm going to wait until 2:30.
No one knew who I was.
I want to go.
I'm clean.
The island is easy to reach by boat.
I ran a race with him.
When was the last time you danced?
"In the near future, we will be able to put an end to AIDS."
When is Tom arriving?
What's that on your shirt?
I'm the only one who can do that.
Shut up!
Tom lost his son in a car accident.
He is too drunk to drive home.
The smell was terrible.
I like cats.
I am injured.
I'd like to see a doctor.
My schedule is rather tight.
Tom has a rice cooker.
I need money.
All that glitters is not gold.
Honesty is no guarantee of success.
The students did the work themselves.
I was surprised when Tom told me I had to do that.
My father would often go fishing.
I want to come back next year.
Tom is a rabbi.
The boy complained of a headache.
Tom made an excuse for being late.
Almost all Japanese boys like to play baseball.
"Excuse me, is Tom here today?"
Grab your gear.
I have a reservation for six-thirty.
Is there anything on the floor?
Fire is always dangerous.
Is that wrong?
You have to read everything.
Your English is improving.
He was sound asleep.
Tom is a good person.
I can't do that yet.
I can't remember any of it.
The museum is around the corner.
Somebody is standing in front of his room.
Tom narrowly escaped being killed.
Which subject do you like the most?
That's all I have.
Please give me a pillow and a blanket.
Why do you work here?
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
"You're finally going to be a June bride, aren't you?"
Tom says he's cut down on drinking.
That isn't our only problem.
Cars made in Japan are used all over the world.
You speak fluent English.
All the apples that fall are eaten by the pigs.
When did Tom buy that?
Don't get angry.
This is my email address.
I can tell you what Tom thinks.
Wow! It's been a long time.
It's OK.
Tom has everything he needs.
Please turn right.
I'd like to find out where our meeting will be.
He ran so fast that I couldn't catch up with him.
You talk too much.
I've never eaten Chinese food.
Don't make a scene in public.
How boring!
We'll fight.
I'd like to see that.
I agree completely.
He did not expect to live so long.
Seriously?
Don't you want to know who that man is?
When are you leaving?
Tom finally gave up smoking.
"I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave."
Please go to the bank.
That sound is annoying.
Please sum up your idea.
She told me that she would go to Paris in August.
How late is it?
What do you mean?
"Since he could not work out the problem that way, he tried another way."
I play tennis after school.
It is written in simple English.
My mother is a high school teacher.
Tom put on his raincoat.
Can anyone drive?
When's your birthday?
The holiday traffic crawled along the highway.
So long.
Tom really misses Mary.
I'm just messing with you.
Have you ever been to Japan?
Do you like it all?
I'm awfully tired.
Stay home.
He's my brother.
They aren't coming today.
Recently he's become a really nice person.
We tried.
"If I had been rich, I would have given you some money."
We are worried about you.
It's me.
Keep your eyes open.
I'm never wearing these shoes again.
Tom was out with his friends.
We are going to have a party on Saturday night.
There was a commotion when store security guards detained some young men for shoplifting.
"Hurry up, or you'll be late."
Tom shut the drawer.
Tom posted a lewd photo of himself on social media.
This is on sale.
I like the way it sounds.
A rat ran across the road.
Can we get Tom to do that?
Really?
I'll never forget him as long as I live.
No one is doing anything.
May I take a rest?
Crying is normal.
Will you tell me how to get to Shinjuku?
"Turn on the light, please."
Let me try it.
Tom's eyes are blue.
Tom is not able to swim.
What've you got?
I wonder why everybody left so early.
Eat slowly.
Tom jumped off the roof.
Did you buy anything to eat?
The visitor sat across from me.
I think I can come over this afternoon.
"Irene Pepperberg, a researcher at Northwestern University, is discovering that a parrot can not only mimic people but also learn the meaning of words."
What did he look up?
Tom speaks very fast.
It was Tom that broke the window yesterday.
Thanks for this.
Tom seems to be looking for someone.
I am going to play tennis.
I have nothing better to do.
The rain lasted for three days.
Tom looks puzzled.
Are your hands clean?
I lost my camera the other day.
You'd better do what I suggest.
"Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it."
Where's Boston?
I'm not bluffing.
I wasn't talking about Tom.
Tom shouldn't even be there.
I am terribly hungry.
My opinions are similar to his.
He looks just like his father.
Would you like to eat?
He's under the chair.
His new film is worth seeing.
"Instead of going to school, he stayed at home."
The work was very difficult.
I love egg yolks.
Where did they go?
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Take off your socks.
What's it we're waiting for here?
What have you been doing this week?
What should I bring?
I really do need your help.
You had better not speak loudly in this room.
When was the last time you ate out?
How about going for a swim?
I hope Tom passes the exam.
Just because you're my girlfriend doesn't mean I have to agree with you.
Tom needs all the help he can get.
I'm eating rice now.
Take a seat.
Prepare to evacuate.
Please stop.
Don't expect too much of him.
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Could I borrow your car?
I shouldn't have run that red light.
"I knew he was angry, but I didn't think he was that angry."
It can't be!
We're both fine.
You need to stay awake.
The next-door neighbor looked out the window when Tom yelled.
No stitches were needed.
I stayed home for a week.
Tom blacked out.
I didn't know anything about his plan.
Why don't dogs like cats?
Not very many of us know how to speak French.
What have you learned about Tom?
We must cut spending.
I don't have those answers.
She was born and brought up in Osaka.
I don't agree with you.
It seems a waste of time to wait any longer.
Can we use a calculator?
Do you know the real reason Tom isn't here?
Tom doesn't like the idea.
I have to get home.
I was expecting you last night.
I want to know what you're thinking.
"It is very hot in this room, isn't it?"
I think Tom will return soon.
You forgot to warn us not to drink the water.
Tom clicked the light off.
It isn't enough.
You can't lift the piano.
That's peculiar.
I haven't heard of him since then.
Do you have any idea why Tom doesn't like Mary?
I want to be able to speak French fluently.
He doesn't care about money.
"Is Tom here, too?"
Do you know any of the boys in this room?
I think your answer is correct.
We apologize.
Tom blinked.
There is a cat.
We have to stay here until Tom gets back.
Tom is a student.
Tom and Mary played tennis all day long.
I'll do better next time.
I do it every Sunday morning.
Are you happy right now?
Do you have a dictionary?
"Out of twenty students, only one had read the book."
She suffocated him with a pillow.
The impact of science on society is great.
I think you've got the flu.
How much time does the average teenager watch TV every day?
I'm not always so lenient.
The 1990s began with the Gulf incident.
He sat in the chair.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
What happened here?
I've failed.
I have two brothers and one sister.
They will die.
I bought a dozen spoons and two dozen forks.
Mary doesn't like men who look like Tom.
That was probably what influenced their decision.
I almost missed my train.
Tom spends a lot of his time reading.
Tom lied to you.
What was your mother doing when you returned home?
Are these yours?
Did you do your homework by yourself?
Most guitars have six strings.
"It's OK to be scared, Tom."
The population explosion is a serious problem.
Berlin is the largest city in Germany.
I've just arrived at the station.
Be careful!
I can't do it.
Who deleted the file?
"May I see your passport, please?"
Tom needs to follow my advice.
Try to keep from crying.
I don't like chocolate.
I just wish you'd told me before.
Tom grudgingly did what Mary asked.
My house faces to the south.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
Do you want to try?
How horrible!
Try this on. It's your size.
Tom is very interested in Australian history.
What did you do then?
Frayed electrical cables can be very dangerous.
Tom offered me a cup of coffee.
Tom recommended that I apply for the job.
That's my best guess.
I just lay on the beach and watched people swim.
"I'm moving to Boston next week. ""I miss you already."""
"Knowing is nothing, imagination is everything."
He's stronger than you.
We'll be rescued.
Would you like to come?
We all wear uniforms to school.
Many famous people are behind the movement.
That should get Tom's attention.
My watch keeps very good time.
You're quite right.
You must start soon.
Could you please not smoke in this room?
Don't make me go back there.
His data is often inaccurate.
Cut that out!
Why is my bag empty?
The snow lasted for two days.
Let me see that.
I'm glad I was able to help.
"In that respect, I agree with you completely."
I want to be Tom's friend.
She has ten children.
Bauxite is the main source of aluminium.
It'll burn.
Many thanks.
Where is the closest hospital?
He did his best never to think of her.
Where would you like to go?
No one noticed till it was too late.
I suspect that Tom doesn't do his homework by himself.
When will you visit me again?
I refuse.
Tom was standing at the foot of the stairs.
I'm saving money for my old age.
You're cuter than your sister.
What is your name?
She's from Somalia.
This bicycle belongs to my brother.
I am ashamed of having done so.
He's a carbon copy of his father.
"Push the button, please."
I still think Tom is guilty.
I think my exam went well.
His grandfather bought him the expensive toy.
She was invited to a party.
Tom always talks as if he knows everything.
Do you really want to eat that?
It's strange.
The ceremony has ended.
I caught five fish yesterday.
You'd better hurry up.
We don't know where we are.
What do you want to say?
"Sorry, I forgot."
"Which is heavier, lead or gold?"
I like going to the movies.
Put on your gloves.
"I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend."
It's clear that you're wrong.
"Gold, bauxite, and diamonds are Guinea's main exports."
I will have obtained a driver's license by the end of the year.
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary.
I've lost my ticket.
You'll never be alone.
He hired some new workers.
Close that door.
Stand still!
That house is very small.
I've been in that line of work for five years.
Africa is a continent.
It seemed to be cheap.
My mother has cooked ten eggs.
Divide this among yourselves.
President Reagan's tax program has not worked.
What do you think of reggae?
You'll lose everything.
His new film is disappointing.
Languages are subject to constant change.
French has many more vowels than Japanese.
It's been a long time since I've seen my family.
I saw Tom in the hall.
When will you leave?
Tom has shaved off his mustache.
What'll you have?
I've never been to Europe.
It's exactly what I thought.
She has a cheerful personality.
Is it raining?
Is it true that men have oilier skin than women?
The audience appeared bored.
"If Tom was angry before, he'll be furious now."
This room will soon heat up.
When will you return home?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to see Mary.
You didn't need to hurry.
What did you do that for?
Maybe someone made Tom do it.
She's assertive.
Maybe I shouldn't stay here.
Tom ran across the road.
Wasn't it awful?
Give me your money.
You are my best friend.
Why do you know so much about Australia?
I surprised Tom.
The road runs parallel to the river.
Do you ever think about Tom?
I've just had new tires put on my car.
Tom is playing with his dog in the yard.
You can't be a doctor.
When are you walking home?
"She's not young, is she?"
This box contains apples.
"There are many, many planets in the Milky Way which are just as big as Jupiter."
Tom can't play tennis.
He's intelligent.
You won't need that.
Paris is the capital of France.
Leave the book where it was.
Tom is relocating to Boston.
Your shoes are here.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
It was a party to celebrate her birthday.
I'm starved.
It's time to eat.
This room is just about big enough.
I haven't received any email today.
Why don't you have a party?
We'll fix it.
It was a foolish mistake.
They're eating apples.
Do you see this?
Is this true?
Tom continued talking.
France is in Western Europe.
Let's turn back.
I don't get you at all.
Have you seen him before?
Tom is a good cook.
This room has three windows.
The vase was broken to pieces.
I was searched by the customs officers at the airport.
What time do you go to the market?
This bed looks solid.
Your hand is as cold as ice.
No one will see us.
She is beautiful.
I'd like to master English.
You look quite sick.
"If Tom doesn't mind, I'd like to join him for lunch."
This problem deserves considering.
They are frantically backpedaling.
Open your book to page nine.
"This morning, I saw an angel."
Tom was just about to say something when the door opened.
The possibilities were endless.
It's a pity that you couldn't come.
Is there a cat on the table?
I don't have enough money to buy a car.
Everything I've told you may not be true.
This is a great question.
Tom is liked by his friends.
What time do you usually leave home?
"Plenty of opportunities will present themselves, if only you are awake to them."
Tom is smarter than I am.
The police can't find Tom.
Have you seen anything?
Why don't you believe me?
It's probably going to rain this afternoon.
I came yesterday.
Perhaps she doesn't remember my birthday.
Tom looks bewildered.
I saw him crossing the street.
I've always liked soccer.
Tom ignored me.
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone.
The old man was hit by a car and was immediately taken to the hospital.
"I know you've been waiting a long time, but could you wait just a little bit longer?"
How long will Tom stay with us?
He shot at me.
Give me a bottle of wine.
You are new students.
I'm eating rice now.
Don't make fun of people.
Tom told Mary that he didn't have to do anything.
Didn't you use to be a teacher?
I met her an hour ago.
Tom didn't even ask for my permission.
The company rewarded him with promotion.
Don't say his name.
Tom did as I told him.
Tell me about your job.
"When I bite down, this tooth hurts."
Be sure to bring rain gear.
Anything you could do in support of their effort would be very much appreciated.
That is the funniest joke that I have ever heard.
I'm sleepy!
I'm going with you.
Tom isn't able to swim.
There are still a lot of things that have to be done.
Your time has come.
Would you like another cup of coffee?
Please stop!
I'd like to buy a refrigerator.
There's no way I'm going to do that.
Could you stay out of this?
I can't afford to shop at such an expensive store.
Their offer to buy the house was rejected.
I have some things for you.
Everyone is waiting for you.
We always have to obey the rules.
I can't take Tom's money.
I have nothing to say to you.
Is this some kind of practical joke?
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
"Tom loved Mary, who didn't love him at all."
Tom was good at that.
I helped write that report.
We plan to stay a week.
I love sports. I get that from my father.
There's snow on top of the mountain.
Mistakes happen.
Do you really think that I'm going to let you do that?
Could we have a table outside?
Why didn't you believe me?
Tom went to Boston the day before yesterday.
Have you thought this through?
My father is not talkative.
Is this book yours?
What do you think this means?
"You can swim, can't you?"
I'd like to put something in the hotel safe.
You just made my day.
I bought a red sports car.
I'll buy you a drink.
You're aggressive.
We sat in front of the fireplace.
You are selling him short.
Tom pointed to the chair next to his.
Pick up that paper there on the floor.
I feel like having a drink.
I can't find my glasses.
Tom is afraid of dying.
Have you turned in your report?
You don't listen.
I would like to see that.
There is a glass on the table.
I didn't touch your guitar.
What did you buy?
What a pity!
I think I mistakenly sent that email to Tom.
Do you know what time it is?
Keep an eye on the baby for a while.
He will come soon.
He often plays guitar.
The horse is jumping.
Good job!
Banks open at nine o'clock.
Be careful.
Do you still read books?
We won the lottery.
My driving instructor says I should be more patient.
He's very intelligent.
We've known each other for years.
Tom and Mary have been dating for three months.
Some dog owners wonder if they are feeding their dogs enough.
Don't be noisy in this room.
This is Tom.
You'd better take care of it soon.
You always try to blame somebody else.
Have you washed the car yet?
"I suspected that he was telling a lie, but that didn't surprise me."
He became a pianist.
Where is your room?
I think they're using you.
We have only three left.
He decided to quit smoking.
It's raining.
What fun would that be?
"Oh, really?"
The octopus is hiding in a coconut shell.
Do you remember us?
We're not entirely sure why Tom did what he did.
She is a student.
Let's wait for the rain to stop.
The rules should be followed.
"Tom is quite successful, isn't he?"
I would never do it again.

At what time does it close?
My hobby is fishing.
Why me?
Can you get it repaired?
Tom is a bookworm.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Tom doesn't like being called cute.
I'm hungry.
People sometimes make illogical decisions.

His name is Tom.
They live in a house.
A driver was sleeping in the car.

Just watch and learn.
Let's go to the beach.

What about Tom?
You should start getting ready.
Tests start next week.
Let's have a try.
He's my older brother.
I need to know for sure.
Tom can't even play one song on his ukulele without making mistakes.
That's absurd.

These flowers have died.
I didn't actually do anything.
We're both fine.
How long have you been studying French?
Tom is a politician.
Tom will improve.
I have the feeling that I'll sleep well tonight.
Tom put his seatbelt back on.
"May I have a road map, please?"
The water's warm enough for a swim.
I'm giving it back.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Nearly 80 percent of the land is mountains.
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
I'm looking forward to it.
"My name's Tom, too."
Keep your room as neat as you can.
What do you want to eat?
How much did you guys spend?
Where am I now?

I didn't want to waste it.
Is there a problem with my work?
Would you like something to drink?
We're ambitious.
What will we be doing this time next week?
I'm not the only one here who thinks Tom isn't a nice guy.
Let's cross here.
Tom's concerned.
"You may stay here if you like, as long as you keep quiet."
Would you please open the window?
We have a reservation for six-thirty.
Would you carry my luggage upstairs?
My children don't have their own rooms.
It's necessary to go through customs on arriving.
That's unfortunate.
I guess Tom didn't get around to painting the barn last summer.
Let's just do it now.
Why do you think it was Tom who did that?
The train was about to leave.
She is looking for her car keys.
There are ten people in this room.
Let's make this simple.
This is a pay phone.
Let's do that.
You must not touch the paintings.
Keep reading.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to do that for you.
The hole is big enough.
Tom is having fun.
We've done what we can.
Children learn to respond to rhythmical sounds from a very young age.
You have to go back.
We're going to the theater.
We hope you can help us.
Is Tom left-handed?
The pig is growing fat.
I'm accustomed to getting up early.
I understood what she said.
Please shuffle the cards carefully.

How many pictures did you buy?
He's not here yet.
I can't go abroad this year.
I don't know when Tom started studying French.
Have you eaten dinner yet?
Hi. How are you?
The students must not enter the teachers' room this week.
Wake up.
"Watch your mouth, Tom."
May I run with you?
Tom lives in a three-bedroom house on the outskirts of Boston.
I'm always surprised by him.
The island is a paradise for children.
She is able to grasp the situation.
The earth is round.
I met Tom tonight.
Awesome!
I know what Tom is going to do.
What can I do for you?
They paid customs duties.
I know that you lied to me the other day.
English is a global language.
We kept on working for hours without eating anything.
The meeting was last month.
I like fish more than meat.
Tom kept on talking.
They're all watching TV.
I'll show you the car I've just bought.
He could find her house easily.
I usually eat outside.
Keep an eye on them.
Don't change a thing.
Mistakes do happen.
What language do they speak in the United States?
You're still young.
Let's go to sleep.
What grade is Tom in?
It was your mistake.
The planes flew over the village.
The boy tried moving the heavy sofa.
Listen to who's talking.
I had intended to go there.
That should be enough.
This hotel does not serve lunch.
I can't even remember my own name.
That's why I have to do this.
Let me see that list.
Where are you heading?
He breathed his last breath.
I'd like you to read this book.
Books are made out of paper.
Tom's my friend.
I need cash.
I met him by chance at the airport yesterday.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
I want to go abroad.
What's our situation?
That's what they were planning.
Have you already eaten dinner?
It looks like you were right.
Tom poured cold water over his head.
I don't want to say that to my girlfriend.
You need to be more careful.
You're in better shape than I am.
Tom said he didn't think that it was possible.
Turn on CNN.
We did our best.
I'm not as big a fool as you think I am.
You should be more careful.
Tom really likes playing the guitar.
Where's there a supermarket around here?
That won't help you.
I slipped and twisted my ankle.
How can you be so calm?
The wind is blowing from the north.
Which sports do you like?
Did you buy anything to eat?
We've decided to move the meeting to next Sunday.
"If you really want to help, please come by 2:30."
The proverb is familiar.
What time can you come?
She felt like crying.
I'll be in my car.
What are you looking at?
Don't make me laugh!
I'm tracking a buck.
She took care of his wound.
There's nothing I like as much as the smell of roses.
You were at my wedding.
I want to know what's funny.
He's my brother.
Does this sound familiar?
He was destined to become a great musician.
I come from Australia.
That guy over there looks like Tom.
Call my husband.
Tom gets tired quickly.
"Hi, guys."
We must always do our best.
I've tried that already.
The program ended at 7:00 p.m.
Nature is full of mystery.
It's no problem.
It's just a hobby.
What we do is up to you.
"Excuse me, I'm here to see Tom."
I've been to the bank.
I will get up early tomorrow.
Show me your passport.
"He won't come, will he?"
Tom will go far.
I have to go to the toilet.
Summer vacation begins next Monday.
Do you know my name?
Why don't you just find another place to live?
Don't bother me.
Tom seems puzzled.
The king oppressed his people.
Enough is enough.
Well done!
Do it later.
Tom probably has better things to do with his time than sit in meetings all day.
You've set a bad example.
We don't want to scare the children away.
Tom can't even read.
It's not a trick.
It was too bad you couldn't come.
She visited her husband in prison.
Stay out of the rain.
I think we'd better help Tom.
I don't approve your decision.
We're watching Tom.
I could neither see nor hear the speaker.
"Could you call again later, please?"
Would you like a glass of orange juice with your breakfast?
You mustn't tell anyone.
Tom is Mary's best friend.
Do I look like an idiot?
Tom seems upset.
The accident happened on Sunday at about 3:00.
Please call a taxi.
Stop spending money on stupid things.
You don't need to answer this question.
Don't kid me!
We think Tom will be ready.
He has coached us for half a year.
"Sorry, I can't stay for long."
You've got a great sense of humor.
I apologized to Tom for what I did.
I'm writing a message to Tom.
The movie starts at ten o'clock.
I'm not giving you any more money.
We both have the same name.
We've got major problems.
Stop worrying about me.
"After getting through customs, I was free to go wherever I wanted."
The moon is the earth's only satellite.
Tom has a son who is a construction worker.
We can't be sure Tom will do that.
Don't stay here.
Come sing with me.
We were caught in a storm.
I don't like you anymore.
Are you sure of that?
I know who your secret admirer is.
Tom said Mary has been trying to be cooperative.
I like how it sounds.
I appreciate this.
She couldn't convince him to ask for a loan.
I'll give you this pendant.
I am in no position to do anything about it.
No one has been here.
Tom began to understand.
I thought it was true.
"Read it again, please."
Is Tom staying at the Hilton Hotel?
I want your opinion.
She gave birth to a healthy baby.
"If I'm reincarnated, I want to come back as a cat."
Tom took us to the zoo.
The child soon fell asleep in the bed.
We're cultured.
What is on the desk?
We'll fight to the last.
I don't think so.
Tom was quite helpful.
Tom's skull has been fractured.
Forget him.
What color car did you buy?
Is there anything I can do for you?
They won.
I'm 18 years old.
Why didn't you try and stop Tom?
That was our home.
What's the matter?
Iker Casillas is the best goalkeeper in the world.
Could you please do me a favor?
I'm not illiterate.
Don't you get it?
Have you finished your lunch yet?
I don't have anything to say to you.
"In order to buy a ticket, you'll have to wait at least an hour."
I'm not stupid.
I'm not a journalist.
Who did you hear this news from?
Everybody knows them.
She can take control of the situation.
Do you know what the difference is?
Where would you like to go?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
Please move your car out of here.
Tom is three years older than his wife.
You are deceiving yourself.
My feet hurt.
Night is when most people sleep.
My brother is a teacher.
I don't care what Tom looks like.
The event made him famous.
The station is a ten minute drive from here.
Thanks very much.
"When my wife finds out, she won't be happy."
Where've you been?
"Tom knew something went wrong, didn't he?"
It's all my fault.
I'm not feeling well.
What's the matter?
We try.
"Tom is still in kindergarten, isn't he?"
Tom left about an hour ago with Mary.
I can get you everything you need.
The arrow indicates the way to go.
Such things often happen by accident rather than by design.

You have very acute hearing.
You're not a child anymore.
I can't put up with this hot weather.
Tom drives too fast.
Don't underestimate me.
The student hall is for benefit of the students.
Hold on a second.
Pipe down!
Tom probably doesn't even know why I don't like him.
He is allergic to house dust.
I remember seeing you somewhere.
I broke Tom's nose.
Tom played a trick on Mary.
What is it you want to tell us?
The hunting dogs followed the scent of the fox.
We totally forgot about lunch.
Which house did you live in?
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How are you?
Are you new?
Tom studies hard.
Is this going to take a while?
I'm worn out.
Anything else?
It's been a difficult day.
We're having dinner right now.
You were late for work.
I invited them to the party.
Let's let Tom do it.
Traffic lights are used to regulate traffic.
Tom didn't mean it.
I feel hungry.
I've caught a terrible cold.
Put on your good shoes.
Give me something to write with.
Attack!
You're not a child anymore.
Where is the station?
Tom is almost as tall as you are.
You're very courageous.
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
I must refuse.
Tom offered his seat to an old lady.
Can you see the big white building over there?
Tom has been good to me.
Is there another exit?
My hobby is skiing.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
"Is your new wife Canadian, too?"
"Tom seems very angry, doesn't he?"
We'll do what Tom suggested.
I can't give up smoking.
I wonder if I should really become a teacher.
I really want you to be happy.
Everyone here is friendly.
Only my mother understands me.
I just assumed Mary was Tom's girlfriend.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
Please tell me about your company.
That isn't my problem.
It's very noisy in here.
Open the box.
Is this computer connected to the Internet?
May I speak to Tom?
Tom is very worried about you.
We realize now that Tom knew exactly who Mary was.
Their hut is situated in the valley.
"Tom, you're pretending to be asleep, aren't you?"
Tom is older than me.
How high can you jump?
I feel tired.
Don't even go there.
What's in your pocket?
That's strange.
"Seen from a distance, she's a beauty."
Stop that!
What grade is Tom in?
I intend to be there by 2:30.
It depends on the context.
Tom probably forgot it's here.
Tom showed Mary how to sharpen a knife.
I'll visit a museum today.
It's like one of those.
I'm shorter than you.
Do you really love Tom?
British people are used to standing in queues.
Why are you looking so sad?
You can smoke in this room.
Our plane took off exactly at 6 p.m.
The rich have many friends.
"How old are you? ""I'm 16 years old."""
Birds fly in the sky.
Tom died of rabies after having been bitten by a bat.
He gets mad very easily.
It's on the sofa.
Did Tom say anything to you about that?
"Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library."
This room is very warm.
What I say is true.
I can do that.
Wolves won't usually attack people.
I want to be more than friends.

The dog has a very keen sense of smell.

She swims well.
Is it a recent picture?
This is the hotel that we always stay in.
We're out of money.
I want to sing a song.
I can't take any more.
How long have you been abroad?
I can come tomorrow.
The Normans conquered England in 1066.
She will come back before long.
What have you been doing these past few months?
Please turn on the radio.
Today's Tom's birthday.
I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
I like science fiction novels.
"After all, it's reasonable."
He did not intend to hurt your feelings.
He went to the shop.
Tom was exhausted.
We saw an island in the distance.
"When it comes to fishing, he's an expert."
Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
We'll speak to Tom.
Tom borrowed some money from Mary.
Tom and Mary were talking to each other.
"If you don't eat, you die."
You may go there.
He and his mother went shopping.
Are you positive?
Tom still loves it here.
What's your major?
I don't know whether to cry or to laugh.
Tom stood in line.
They stayed at the hotel for a week.
"When the police arrived, the thieves had disappeared."
I don't believe you.
Where were you?
I don't know what you mean.
Tom said doing that would be a good idea.
Why do horses wear blinders?
He drew two squares on the blackboard.
I'm not being paid enough.
Do not forget to meet me at the station.
We finished the work.
I'll drive you to the airport.
Tom came here to ask us to help him.
Come soon.
Why do you need change?
How many classes do you have on Monday?
I'm only joking.
I guess you didn't get my message.
You should see a doctor.
Did Tom go alone?
Don't cry.
Why doesn't Tom like Mary?
Don't you get lonely?
It's too noisy in here.
We're nonsmokers.
I wish I wasn't married.
Tom never backs down.
Tom's family moved to Australia in 2013.
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I was frightened.
Other people's expectations affect how we behave.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Her house is very modern.
I think I'll go now.
Tom hid himself under the table.
He took Tom on a fishing trip.
Bless you.
I couldn't anticipate that that would happen.
I wonder why Tom needs that.
What makes you say that?
Tom gave Mary his kidney.
I have a twin brother.
I am sorry for you.
The swimming pool is open to the public.
I will write to you as soon as I can.
Can it be phrased in another way?
Don't throw stones.
Are you taking any medicine regularly?
Tom dug up the potatoes.
Tom wants me to take his place.
They didn't believe me.
He disregarded my advice.
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
"You're joking, right?"
"Tom likes Mary. ""I think that's obvious to everyone."""
I think it's a good idea.
I love chocolate.
Are they all the same?
We did what we could.
Tom started playing the violin when he was thirteen.
You haven't changed at all.
Tom is sitting at the table over there.
Please return it by 10 a.m. Monday.
This is not a joke.
It's Tom's birthday today.
Is this your letter?
"You can make an educated guess, can't you?"
It must've been love.
Here's my email address.
Gold is far heavier than water.
Do you have some milk?
Don't mention it.
I know you're going to say no.
I can't bear this any longer.
A truck ran over our dog.
Tom raised the three children by himself.
Everyone makes mistakes.
"I tried to warn her, but she wouldn't listen."
Didn't I tell you so?
My internet connection was cut off.
There's a swimming pool not too far from where I live.
Put in a little more sugar.
Are you joking or are you serious?
Tom heard Mary singing in the shower.
They changed it very recently.
"I don't know what's going on around here, but I intend to find out."
How long do you think it takes to go from here to Tokyo?

He kept me waiting for a long time.
People who drive cars should wear seat belts.
Which is your favorite team?
The fountain is over there.
Did she say that?
It's odd.
Tom is taller than his mother.
"Pass me the salt, please."
I'm usually punctual.
There were no radios in those days.
Don't worry.
Let's do it this way.
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
"If you had come only two minutes earlier, you could have caught the bus."
Please fill out the Customs Declaration Form.

Tom had to do some work.
Let's get out of the rain.
What do you want to drink?
I'm not a student.
Do you have enough money?
You may be right.
Tom looks as if he lost his best friend.
I'm not joking.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom wanted a sports car and wasn't at all interested in even looking at family cars.
Our plane landed in Boston just before the storm hit.
You've got a lot of guts.
Do you understand what you're saying?
Who did you write a letter to?
What's made you decide to work for our company?
Tell her that I am looking for the keys.
Do you know where Tom has been the past three weeks?
Don't let me down.
I went inside.
This is silly.
That's the correct answer.
Hurry!
Tom is ready to come home.
She and I are about the same height.
I don't want pizza. I'm not hungry.
Tom can no longer afford to live in the style he is accustomed to.
Smile.
Tom never goes to places like that.
I couldn't convince Tom.
You deserve the prize.
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
They didn't say a word to each other for the rest of the school year.
Tom lost his hat.
The only way to handle him is to let him think he is having his own way.
Do you really think I'd rather live in Boston than Chicago?
She has long arms and legs.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Tomorrow is when I get paid.
That's it. I've done everything I can.
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
I will be at home tomorrow.
We discussed the plan yesterday.
Do you work out regularly?
Where were you the entire afternoon?
Tom asked me to tell you he'd be late.
You don't need to worry about that.
Where's the nearest department store?
He can be trusted.
Wake up!
Two hundred people died of cholera last year.
It's entirely my fault.
Pollution can be controlled.
"So, what do you suggest?"
Are you sure about that?
The debate is continuing.
"You know Tom is a friend of Mary's, don't you?"
You should not go alone.
The bus hasn't come yet.
I was at home all day yesterday.
Tom is a man you can rely on.
What are you going to drink?
They left early.
I am a college student.
I'd rather go swimming.
I think you should talk to Tom about this.
Tom boarded the ship along with his three children.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.

Is French hard to learn?
A strong wind was blowing.
Tom has been quite cooperative.
I'm hungry!
Let's find something to sit on.
I have to find Tom now.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Tom probably went out for some air.
Nobody understands.
I thought you might be too busy to help.
Friendship requires mutual trust.
I know Tom is innocent.
Tom hid under the table.
It's a joke.
A lot of birthday cards will arrive soon.
I didn't want to humiliate Tom.
A banker's life is difficult.
He took a book from the shelf.
I wish I could figure out how to convince Tom to help us.
I don't need your job.
He was relieved of his heavy responsibility.
"We are all equal before the law, but the rich often have a big advantage."
I'm just joking.
Have you ever had food poisoning?
It's none of your business.
Let's talk about your job.
He was elected governor of Texas in 1994.
That sounds like a very good deal.
What makes this so different?
What do you mean?
Tom works every day but Sunday.
I think I will take a vacation this week.
I had no choice but to go there.
Get everyone out of here.
Are we sinking?
Where have you gone?
Tom signed the contract this morning.
She goes to the library every other day.
You'd better leave us alone.
I'll never ask you for anything else.
Got it?
No one cares.
Do you have a bicycle?
The professor's boring lecture put me to sleep.
Tom is eating alone.
I'll phone you every night.
This plant doesn't need a lot of light.
I was a little nervous.
You have to read everything.
Dinner's getting cold.
This book is worth reading over and over again.
I know what Tom would do.
Tom is getting jealous.
I have failed.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
The weather has been good until today.
Where have you been?
We can get a glimpse of the lifestyle of ancient people from this wall painting.
Don't work too hard.
Tom pretended to be ignorant.

She is mad at me.
What's the best way to do that?
I'll explain it all to you later.
Tom can't run very fast.
Tom wants to be the boss.
Why do you need this?
You've got to be kidding!

I have to use the restroom.
May I use your phone?

Look at that big dog.
Can you guess how old I am?
Tom goes to school on foot.
Tom parked his car next to Mary's.
I don't trust you.
Tom works every day except Sunday.
I need a stamp.
It takes 10 minutes to walk to the station.
I can't put up with this any longer.
Where is my car?
It's a confidential matter.
Did anything interesting happen while I was gone?
We were so afraid.
This is the last straw.
Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
Do you see that?
Let's do it after school.
I'm allergic to synthetic rubber.
Tom asked Mary to lower her voice.
He was scared you would shoot him.
Tom promised me he wouldn't do that again.
I hope I didn't interrupt you.
Do you think Tom is still alive?
She went inside.
He gets a haircut three times a month.
What did Tom wear to the party?
The sun is setting.
Have you ever gotten food poisoning?
Tom woke up the next day with a painful hangover.
I like apples.
Please give me a sheet of paper.
You can't leave me here alone with Tom.
Tom didn't explain it very well.
I'm getting ready for the worst.
Tom says this is absurd.
Let me get you a brandy.
I heard that Tom's boss refused to give him a raise.
Where did you go?
Tom passed out.
"Hold on, please."

Have you taken your medicine yet?
I don't need an answer right now.

They got married six months ago.
I want something to read.
He doesn't know any of us.
I decided to buy a car.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do it."
"Now, I really have to get going."
"As a result of a traffic jam, he wasn't able to see her off at the station."
You should not go alone.
Tom asked Mary to quit her job.
"If you help me, I'll try it again."
I didn't have lunch today.
I'm not as busy today as I usually am.
Why did she come home early?
"How old is she? ""She is twelve years old."""
Your opinion is similar to mine.
I wish girls found me as attractive as they find Tom.
How is your name spelled?
The royal palace was built on a hill.
Always count your change.
Tom asked me where I got this.
Can you get a day off?
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
Tom paid no attention to Mary.
Tom promised to never be late again.
You are the only one who can save the world.
What train you are going to take?
I really do just want to go.
Tom needs to lower his expectations.
"Do I have your word on that, Tom?"
Tom was executed at dawn.
Who would do such a terrible thing?
Tom might not have enough money to buy what he needs.
Tom suddenly got very scared.
I think Tom has left.
I'm getting hungry.
Tom looks a bit confused.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
They submitted the case to the court.
It happens to everyone.
Tom grew to love the stray dog that followed him home.
You probably don't remember.
"Daddy, I can't walk any more. Could you give me a piggyback ride?"
What's your destination?
Where will we go?
Do you mean what you say?
We all have our faults.
The TV was on all night.
How long did you live on the island?
We can meet.
Tom ran back down the stairs.
Everybody speaks well of her.
I've got a toothache.
Please write down your contact address here.
Is it love?

It is nice to see you again.
It rained hard yesterday.
Tom got in with the wrong crowd during his teenage years and was arrested for car theft several times.
I have already finished reading this book.
We have to do something.
I am afraid of dying.
I didn't know your father had passed away.

We've got a very serious problem.
Help!
He's coming.
You can have whatever you want.
Don't leave me here.
She is a selfish person.
"I've never visited Kagoshima, but I intend to this summer."
Are you all ready?

When was the last time you replaced the filter?
The faucet is leaking.
No problem.
Tom needs it.
Are you on Facebook?
I've lost my wallet.

Where have they gone?
Tell me the story.

Five years have passed since they came to Japan.
Who's he?
Where are you headed?

She is still financially dependent on her parents.
Tom seems to have changed his mind about staying.
I want you guys to meet Tom.

He stood aside for her to enter.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
I appreciate that.
Let go of Tom.
Tom had no intention of helping Mary.
Time is valuable.
Where are the knives?
Tom was fortunate.
What time does the play begin?
Everybody looks up to him.
There's no proof.
"Good morning, everyone."
He made me his assistant.
You shouldn't underestimate me.
He may have told a lie.
They've changed.
Are you joking?
I met up with her on the street.
I'm glad I could help out.
Could you wait a little while?
We just met Tom.

I just ate.
This is what he said.
She has never danced with him.
Someday my dream will come true.
Nobody cares about our problems.
Come here.
Please close the door.
Let's do it!
Tom really likes Mary a lot.
That door is locked.
That's life.
What should I bring?
Hey! Let's start eating.
Have you had dinner already?
She had a healthy baby.
That's a fake.
He's reading a novel now.
Can you read this kanji?
Go to sleep.
You should go home now.

Are you the person in charge?
Whose is that notebook?

He sat surrounded by his grandchildren.
I was still a student then.
I thought Tom and Mary were happy.
Do you cry often?
Tom didn't have to be so formal.
He is still here.
"Even though I'm sitting here in the sun, I still feel cold."
We want to make absolutely sure that Tom wants to do that.
The price of gold fluctuates daily.

I had a small dinner party last weekend.
My sister is fond of music.
You may choose whichever you want.
I cannot help you.
Don't worry about the past.
Business has been good.
I think I remember how to do that.
You just can't give up.
Do you know who this belongs to?
"You know many interesting places, don't you?"
Tom is a university student.
I assume that Tom doesn't have that many friends.
They checked whether the room was empty.
Well done!
You don't need that.
May I hang up your coat?
I want to say something to you.
I'll go no matter what.
We have important work to do.
I no longer want that.
Japan is famous for Mt. Fuji.
I'll have to think about it.
Tom was happy.
I can't stand it any longer.
Don't move!

You're not the only one who's hungry.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
My bicycle was stolen.
"Tom tried his best to get here, but he didn't make it."
I don't want to waste my time on this.
Don't you feel it?

I don't know anything about Tom's past.
What are you two doing?
Life without love is just totally pointless.
Tom must be asleep.
"He is a nice person, to be sure, but not very clever."
I see no need for Tom to do that.

Please call me up if you want me.
Has Tom gone?
I bought a hat at the store.
I like the way you smile.
Do you want it gift wrapped?

Did you have fun?
I'll call again later.
Where did you buy that book?
Tom looks downcast.
I must study.
Have you eaten supper yet?
"You won't be late, will you?"

Just open the door.
What's the matter?
She held out her hand and I shook it.
I'm counting on you to keep an eye on Tom.
She tends to be late.
Tom saw Mary coming down the stairs.
Tom is 3 years older than Mary.
"So, what do we do in the meantime?"
She forced him to sit down.
What did you buy?

This heater burns gas.
Who is that gentleman?
Is this permissible?
I have two cousins.
I didn't mean to do that.
I don't trust him any longer.
Tom doesn't know what went wrong.
My shoes are worn out.
Do you know Tom's address?

I don't believe anything you say.
When did you become a teacher?
Don't you have an air conditioner?

We are giving Tom a birthday party.
Tom isn't famous.
I will gladly help you.
"Since it was raining, I stayed home."
This is magnificent.
Why was this a secret?
I kid you not.

I need to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I made use of this good opportunity.

How's your brother?
Which one was it?

No way!
Nobody knows where he has escaped to.
I can't live alone.
Will you come tomorrow?
Where is my watch?
Tom tried to deceive Mary.
Tom stayed for a while.
The money disappeared.
The wrestler weighs over 200 kilograms.
Tom makes a lot more money than Mary does.

That's the only possibility.
I told Tom I could do it by myself.
"After eating, the first thing I do is brush my teeth."

Is there any milk left?
Finish your work.
Have you ever donated blood?
Do you like peanut butter?
I like to read story books.
"We'll be seeing you, Tom."
I'm so glad you're back.

"Being together all the time, my Japanese classmates got to know each other very well."
"If Tom wants to go, let him."

I haven't met him even once.
He drove the truck to Dallas.
I don't want to live with that.
These are the clothes that Tom gave me.
Tom was looking for place to eat that had reasonable prices.
Tom approached Mary.
Are you OK?
He's still young.
That won't happen.
Don't walk alone after dark.
My life was in danger.

That isn't what I was saying at all.
Tom can't make up his mind.
That looks suspicious to me.
I have to get up early.

You can depend on his help.
Tom said he'll call you later.
Tom walks slowly.
That's wonderful.

We're closed today.
I like lasagna.
Don't trust what Tom says.
Get out of bed!
I wish I could've stayed longer.
Tom saw Mary heading into the woods.
Tom is cranky.
This bottle holds one liter.
It was Tom who told me that.
I don't feel well.
Where's the station?

Tom needs a cab.
You can go home if you like.
I know what I'm feeling.
You are not a coward.
Even Tom is a little surprised.
I'm extremely tired.
Give it to me.
You'd better tell Tom not to do that.
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
Anybody can make a mistake.
I should go home before my parents start to worry.
Someone is knocking on the door.
It's getting worse and worse.
It rained continuously all day.
Can he speak English?
I've read both books.
Tom looked down at the ground.

Please don't die.
I want a puppy.
I'd like to see your father.
"Since the Industrial Revolution, the world population has more than tripled."
It's all happening so fast.
How did you spend your holiday?

My shoelace got caught in the escalator.
How is it going?
Do you have any children?
We met along the way.
Today is Tom's birthday.
You must fulfill your duty.
Tom is distressed.
Leave me alone.
You have to read everything.
I don't want to embarrass myself.
I'm sleepy.
School begins the day after tomorrow.
Is Tom sick?
I don't like it at all.
I think that you're wrong.

Open the box.

I'll make you happy.
Don't let Tom hear you say that.
Just wait a second.
I don't blame you.

What have you done to Tom?
"A glass of water, please."
"Tom, are you okay?"
Why don't you come dancing with me?
Nobody knows you're here.
We talked late into the night.
"Well, should we get started?"
Tom certainly isn't the genius he thinks he is.
This is ludicrous.
I don't need anything.
Tom might not want to see Mary.
Keep Tom quiet.
I'm a human being.
It never pays to lose your temper.
The house is being painted by a professional.
I returned the knife that I borrowed.
Tom pretended that he didn't see it.

Tom doesn't want anything to drink.
It has been raining since Tuesday.
Your answer is wrong.
We're leaving.
"I'll be back by tomorrow, if possible."
That's strange.
I am positive that he is wrong.
Tom is a perfectionist.
You're too drunk to drive.
You're the one person I can rely on in this kind of situation.
When will you be back?
The bank came through with the loan we had requested.
He's not in yet.
Tom offered Mary a stick of gum.
There is a glass on the table.
It is said that he is a millionaire.
It was the worst day of my life.
I like blue.
Why did you ask?
He is not always busy in the morning.
Your father is tall.
You're totally right.
I don't think I've seen you before.
He declared that they had been friends for 30 years.
She's not a liar.
I need to use the bathroom.
They don't teach you that in school.
Cats don't like water.
Winter is my favorite season.
It was a nice party.
Have you ever been to the Black Sea?
We'll do what Tom suggested.
How about going to the movies?
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
That's weird.
Why don't the three of us have lunch together?
How're you doing?

It was all I could do to keep standing.
I don't believe you.
See you!

She starts her job at seven o'clock.
Why won't you believe me?
The red dress looked good on her.
You are very brave.
We'd like to speak with you.
Don't tell me you're quitting.
Tom needs to change his lifestyle.
Why not have dinner with us?
Tom wondered if Mary could understand French.
I can't take any more.
Do you know what Tom was doing there?
I'll be here when you get back.
I showed her my room.
Let's hope Tom was right.
You'll forget about me someday.
I've been waiting for you for hours.
"I've never been to New York, and my sister hasn't, either."
Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
Was he Tom?
Get a picture of this.

Tom cut himself shaving.
Tom received a fax from Mary this morning.
I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
Tom only found out after his mother's death that she had gambled away his inheritance.
How long does it take to the train station by taxi?
Let's give it a try.
"Is he speaking English, French, or German?"
Look at that cat.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
I couldn't forget you if I tried.
The problem is we don't have enough money.
I'll give it back.
It was not until yesterday that I knew it.
He turned out to be nothing but a liar.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.

Tom saw a boy waiting at the bus stop.

Tom adores Mary.
I need more information.
Is it far from here?
I'm living with my parents.
How much is the bus fare?
I can't stop thinking about what they did to me.
That's preposterous.
Tom isn't quite himself today.
"How old are you? ""I'm sixteen."""
Five times five is twenty-five.
You ought to see a doctor.
I've finished watering the flowers.
I didn't know about this.
Who would want to live in a place like this?
Tell Tom I don't like him.
How do you get to school?
"Tom didn't read the fine print on his insurance policy, and was shocked to find that his claim wasn't covered."
I don't have anything to tell you.
Thanks a bunch.
What's your job?
"I'll come, too."
Do you have a lighter?
Tom couldn't control himself when he saw Mary kissing John.
Remember these rules.
I got off the train.
"I'm fine, thank you."
Italy is a very beautiful country.
Do you have any CDs?
This is a joke.
Where were you going?

Did you order a pizza?
Tom was shot and killed.
Tom resumed sweeping the floor.
I haven't told you everything.
What do you want to drink?
Let's party.
He hit his head against a rock.
My hobby is listening to music.
"She is popular not because of her beauty, but because of her kindness."
"Suddenly, he heard a strange sound."
Tom waited for the applause to die down before he announced the next song.
I am very hungry.
Do you need a place to stay?
Tom misses his family.
Tom loves being outdoors.
Who are those guys?
He's always short of money.
He'll help you if you ask.
That's the only reason Tom and I are going.
I don't like eggs.
Don't go away.
Would you like to travel abroad?

This room is cramped.
When will you leave here?
He came by bus.
We've been cooperative.
I had a room with a beautiful view of the mountains.
What is the highest mountain in North America?
Tom slipped out of the classroom.
Tom is taller than anybody else.
The station is pretty far.
The smell was horrible.
Can you see them?
"Look, Tom, we don't have time for this."
Are you buying into this?
Tom was working last night.
Tom only drinks coffee.
Tom used to come to visit us every summer.
Do you want some coffee?
Tom went to Boston to see Mary.
Would you care to join me?
I keep telling myself it doesn't matter.

"You plan to go out dancing with Mary, don't you?"
Tom wants to kill Mary.
It's exactly as you say it is.

Have you forgotten about me?
I want to teach you something.
Are you down there?
I love eggplant.
You seem to be a busy man.
He had friends all over the world.
I agree to this plan.
He dates the custom from the colonial days.
There's so much I want to do.
I'm not as healthy as I used to be.
I'll phone you later.
Wait!
They left early.
Lying is wrong.
Did you see a doctor?
Tom fell down the stairs and hit his head.
"Could you look at me, Tom?"
This is my room.
Tom didn't find what he was looking for.
Tom decided to ignore the problem.
Tom will go there tomorrow.
Let's do this now.
Do you have Tom's address?
No one saw us.
I can't tell yet.
"Add 5 and 2, and you get 7."
Most of the war damage was there.
Tom pointed to the floor.
"You can dance, can't you?"
I must have made a mistake.
Tom is Mary's boss.
He's an old friend of mine.
I haven't washed my hair.
Where were they?
Tom may not like this at all.
I am eating an apple.
Tom hasn't seen the video yet.
I'm afraid the situation is very serious.
Please remain seated for a few minutes.
I like summer better than winter.
Don't make fun of me.
Isn't that where I taught you how to water ski?
I saw it in a magazine.
What's your favorite kind of art?
The station is 100 meters away.
I'm tired of this.
Don't smoke.
When did you start wearing contact lenses?
I have nothing further to say.
I study math as hard as English.
You should have done so.
Three quarters of them agreed.
I overheard your conversation.
It's up to you.
Please take a look at that picture.
I'm afraid Tom won't be able to come.
The Milky Way is huge.
I don't wish to meet with him again.
Step on it!
Tom could tell that Mary wanted to leave.
I want something cold to drink.
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
It's time to wake up.
The rainforests are disappearing at the rate of tens of thousands of hectares a day.
Listen carefully.
He is certain to succeed.
I know I have a problem.
Perhaps I was wrong.
Tom always wears a hat.
Parties can be a lot of fun.
This is easy.
I can't eat another bite.
Neptune is the eighth planet of the solar system.
Tom moved here three months ago.
Tom couldn't breathe.
We shouldn't have told Tom.
Can I use my medical insurance?

I can't take it any more.

How about taking a rest?
Who wants hot chocolate?
Do you have any children?
He wondered how many times the sun would rise before his salary would.
Don't be afraid.
I eat rice every day.
Tom found me a taxi.
He's not cut out for teaching.
"Do you understand me, Tom?"
Control yourself!
"If you've been drinking, perhaps your spouse can drive you home."
Let's pretend this didn't happen.
It's time to go to school.
Lack of sleep is bad for your health.
It is fun to play cards.
I am meeting my mother at the station at 4 o'clock.
She took care of my dog.
Tom could tell that Mary was pretty scared.
Whose car is this?
He breathed deeply before entering his boss's office.
I realize you're anxious to finalize the details.
That's probably wise.
What is the matter with you?
You must perform your duty.
I saw him run away.
Papua New Guinea was a German colony.
I always have a couple of beach towels in my car.

This novel was written by an American writer.
Are you really a doctor?
You're young.
I'm already accustomed to the heat of summer.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
That isn't fair.
I don't remember any of it.
The customs office is at the border.
Ten paper plates cost one dollar.
I hope he can help you.
Dogs bark.
Can it be fixed?
Tom is nervous.
I thought you might be able to give me a hand.

You should've seen the movie.
She was born at six a.m. on July 17.
What're you waiting for?

His new movie is disappointing.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
I'll help you move to your new house.
"This room is very small, so it is impossible to put more furniture in it."
Tom made me wait for three hours.
I just realized something interesting.

He was blue from the cold.
Put on some music.
We succeeded!

That's not important for you to know.
"Pass me the wine, please."

I can't tell you what I know.
You have the wrong idea about me.
This room has air conditioning.

I want to live forever.
What's your hobby?
Land prices are very high in Japan.
Thank you ever so much.
Why should this happen?
What's your favorite non-alcoholic beverage?
I think about you all the time.
Where did it go?
Who was that who answered your phone?
Tom may get homesick.
"Hurry up, or we'll miss the train."
What time do you get up?
We've been friends ever since.
Tom is immune.
I'll be going with you.
We import tea from India.
I can't live without her.
Dry the pants on the radiator.
I bought Tom a book.
Cool down.
The pain hasn't gone away.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
You were the last person in the office. You should've turned off the lights.

Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
Walk ahead of me.
I like him.
Tom didn't know where he should go.
The accident caused a traffic jam.
I don't know where he lives.
Tom was delighted.
That's what interests me.
You shouldn't tell Tom everything.
Can I take a day off?
He seems sick.

Tom's polite.
Get out of bed.
Let me give you some advice.
Where else in Boston do you want to go?
The bus was late because of the traffic jam.
She complained of a headache.
Tom married a girl much younger than himself.
There is no point in giving him advice.
What made you change your mind?
Perfect!
This is all my fault.
We planted rice.
Tom has never had a mustache.
I was tired.
She asked me for an unreasonable sum of money.
There are cherry trees on each side of the street.
Japanese houses are built of wood and they catch fire easily.

Tom has high blood pressure.
Why should I pay?
You work too hard.
Which subject do you like best?
That's because you're a girl.
Tom was arrested.
The door remained closed.
Cheers!
Button up your shirt.
Why are people always so cynical?
It won't be fun.
I am only joking.
Tom didn't realize what was happening.
Your plan sounds great.
Where were you?
My life would be completely empty without you.
Tom filled the glass with water.
What subjects do you like the best?
I kept a diary when I was younger.
I'll show you how to properly use it.
Tom wouldn't sit down.
Did you catch any fish in the river?
Tom decided to upload the video he took to YouTube.
Tom asked for permission to leave early.
What matters is whether you do your best or not.
Tom tried to convince Mary that the plan wouldn't work.
I am going.
He gets angry very easily.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Nobody is going to stop me.
"It's not going to be a problem, is it?"
Let's go and take a look.
Tom did it.
Tom is a friend of mine.
We won this time.
Paper is made from wood.
That won't happen.
I cannot thank you enough for your assistance.

All right. I'll accept your offer.
He is wearing gloves.
He seems hungry.
Don't point at others.
You seem to like fruit.
We have two children.
She plays golf every weekend.
They feared you.
I'm off to help my friends.
When should we check out?
Three civilians were wounded.
This is my father.
Tom may still be in the hospital.

This picture reminds me of my childhood.
I wish our classroom were air-conditioned.
Keep your classroom clean.
It's entirely up to you.

I heard yelling.
I look forward to it.
Tom is taller than me.
The ink is still wet.
Tom has been expelled.
I guess that's possible.
Tom is courteous.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom has been good.
Is this a picture that you yourself drew?
Where have you two been?
He looks gloomy.
That's the right answer.
Tom really likes antiques.
I'll wait for you in the hotel tomorrow.
I like this.
"I'm glad you could make it, Tom."
Do you want me to wait until you come for me?
Where did Tom get all that money from?
I'm not shy.
What are you doing in my office?
Don't pat me on the head like I'm still a child!
Tom walked in through the front door.
The sky is getting dark.
He delivers newspapers.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I can't help you now.
Tom insisted.
Your English has improved a lot.
That happened a long time ago.
I don't expect anything from you.
This food is too salty.
Why would you want talk to Tom about that?
When did it begin to rain?
Her face turned red.
What woke you up?
I'm taking a walk in a park.
I don't trust you.
He regretted having borrowed that book from her.
Congratulations!
Tom always tries to help other people.
How many bags do you have?
When did you get up?
He arrived shortly after.
Good afternoon.
Tom spoke up for Mary.
What are you thinking about?
You seem to be a busy guy.
I'm glad to see you again.
Is that important?
I walked up the hill.
It didn't mean anything.
I can't take it any more.
"If you say exactly what's on your mind all the time, you're likely to upset a lot of people."
I would rather stay at home.
Tom didn't understand Mary's reasoning.
Let's talk about what we're going to do about it.
This is the first time we've given a concert in Australia.
"How are you feeling, Tom?"
Thanks a million.
They'll be safe here.
I'm not going back.
How long have you been gone?
Tom's wondering if any of his kids will remember that today is Father's Day.
Pollution can be controlled.

Sometimes he acts as if he were my boss.
I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
You should have seen it.
Tom is still crying.
The tank is full.
I really don't want to go to Boston with Tom.
Tom finally met Mary.
Tom knew Mary was hungry.
Tom was eating.
We climbed Mt. Fuji last summer.
Tom set the alarm on his watch.
"Turn on the radio, please."
"If I tell my mother, she'll worry, so I don't think I'll tell her."
I had a stroke last year.
Who told you to do that?
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
The bus stopped and we got on.
I wholeheartedly agree.
What do you want?
Are you like Tom?
May I borrow your dictionary?
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
Tom said he was planning on visiting an old girlfriend in Boston.
Please take a seat.
You're not yourself today.
I can't put up with him any longer.
It doesn't take very long.
She looks confused.
I'll give you five dollars.
Tom arrived at about 2:30.
I have to think about what needs to be done.
Tom might never trust me again.
Do you want me to go with you?
My boss was forced to resign.
Half of the students are absent.
He can cope with the problems.
When was the last time you ate shrimp?
He arrived here last night.
I don't read newspapers much.
The children need you.
Tom was lucky.
Where does he want to go?
What goes on in this room?
Are you going to shoot me?
Nobody's perfect.
I can't give up now.
The plane still hasn't taken off.
My hobby is music.
Nobody pays much attention to Tom.
I couldn't get to sleep.
Tom was OK.
Are we all ready?
"Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can."
Be careful not to make any mistakes.
I'm hiding.
We don't want to be the last ones there.
I'm sorry I didn't call last night.
There were few people in the park.
When do you have breakfast?
I need to find out what to do.
We take oil for granted.
"He isn't here, is he?"
Tom looks baffled.
Tom closed the drawer.
Don't you ever clean your room?
I can't hide my feelings.
"He is, indeed, a hard worker."
I will come with you.
Where has she gone?
Please write with a pencil.
"Since he was very drunk, he couldn't drive his car home."
You can't come tomorrow.
Where's the train station?
You have the wrong number.
Tom won't do that unless you ask him.
Where did you take those pictures?
I can't speak French at all.
Wait for your brother.
We solved both problems.
Turn to the right.
He fits the description in the newspaper.
"You don't smoke, do you?"
I do not trust him any longer.
I'll come to your place.
He works at a bank.
Cats can see even in dark places.
They moved here three years ago.
The group tried to solve social problems.
Sit wherever you like.

I should probably just toss this in the trash.
It happened a long time ago.
Have you been abroad?
"He is not coming, either."
Why did you buy the flowers?
Would you please help me carry my suitcases?
We don't care what he does.
The snowstorm continued.
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
Stop worrying so much.
Where is Customs?
What Tom did was wrong.
I am from Spain.
The room is hot.
Is that true?
This program has both downloading and uploading capabilities.
It takes courage to succeed.
Open the box.
Is everything OK here?
The elephant was brought to the zoo.
Why did you let Tom go to Boston by himself?
Tom looked puzzled.
She came to Japan to study Japanese.
Something was wrong with Tom.
The desk seems small in this room.
Have you ever eaten insects?
He's going to sit here.
I completely agree.
I don't want it anymore.
Hold it!
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Do you want to eat something?
What would you like to drink?
"The cellar is ugly, dark, and stinky."
Find Tom before he hurts someone.
It's not like you to cry at movies.
Do you feel like eating?
Tom realized it was time to leave.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
My grandfather was a farmer.
What do they know?
I was told not to park my car here anymore.
They have been here since 1989.
I felt like an idiot.
Are you guys hungry?
Where did you learn French?
Tom didn't look happy to see you.
You must not give up hope.
We didn't pay Tom.
Let's try once again.
Little did she dream that her son would commit suicide.
You wouldn't be so casual about it if you were directly involved.
Tom was all worn out.
Please be seated.
They have just arrived.
Where are you headed for?
Your house is big.
It's not good to overeat.
There is an urgent need for a new system.
Have you already started learning French?
He has no interest in politics.
Can't you speak English?
"If he had been a little more careful, the accident would have been avoided."
Don't forget Tom.
It's not safe to text while you drive.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
What are you drinking?
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
It's for sale.
This method is sure to work.
I want to know what you think.
"Valentine's Day is close, and I still don't know what to give to her."
We don't get along.
I think Tom is a little paranoid.
There are no health risks.
How long have we been here?
This is verifiable.
Tom narrowly escaped being hit.
He makes good use of his time.
Did anybody come by?
Tom seems confused.
"Come on, guys. This is not funny anymore."
I play volleyball often.
The meeting will be held tomorrow.
The man lent me two books this morning.
This book is yours.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Thank you.
They satisfied their thirst at the spring.
My grandmother passed away peacefully last night.
Could you please pass me the salt?
We've been helping Tom.
You have a good sense of humor.
Where're you going?
Tom never gave in to temptation.
"We're lucky, aren't we?"
Tom is jittery.
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
Why did you buy a flower?
"Hurry up, or you will be late."
Please fix that.
Why is he staring at me?
I'd like two kilos of apples.
Tom seemed uninterested.
How much does this umbrella cost?
Tom could scarcely believe it.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Tom prepared supper by himself.
My favorite sport is skiing.
My family is a large one.
I know you must be frightened.
That was a lie.
Health is worth more than gold.
I wrote her name down so I wouldn't forget it.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
He pretended to be sleeping.
I watched TV this morning.
Is this your first trip abroad?
Do we need to discuss it?
I love this song.
How much is the most expensive car?
The surgeon who did Tom's operation is very experienced and highly regarded.
Tom slowly walked up the stairs.
What a waste of money!
You're too young.
The rain changed into snow.
I want a lot more.
Who told you I was sick?
Keep your hands clean.
Our city is getting bigger and bigger.
Your house is big.
We don't plan to change that.
The meeting finished at nine.
Tom is growing a mustache.
This is the house where I lived when I was young.
Keep driving.
What grade are you in?
Tom saw Mary at the airport.
Make sure you don't hurt yourself.
"Hurry up! If you don't, we'll be late."
Do you feel guilty?
Three sheep were killed by a wolf.
Tom says he knows why you didn't win.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
We have to keep working.
"Goodnight, ladies."
You can handle this without me.
Mary is Tom's secretary.
He's helping me.
I'm going to Europe next week.
You must start soon.
I met him on the street.
The sky is clear almost every day.
Tom was born three months after Mary.
Who will you be coming with?
I am not a doctor.
I want to have a talk with him about my future.
Tom hasn't said a word all evening.
Leave me alone!
My apartment is near here.
Why did you open the box?
Only my mother really understands me.
Nature is cruel.
I'm sick of it.
I can't let you do that and that's all there is to it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Tom left to meet you three hours ago.
Tom is forgetful.
We still have a lot of food left.
Should I go with you?
I want something to drink.
Tom has to get back home.
We need to do something.
How tall are you?
He's reading a novel right now.
Do you really think that was what Tom wanted?
Our new store is due to open in October.
Tom bought himself a new toothbrush.
You should not lose your patience when dealing with kids.
"When I heard it, I was dumbfounded."
I wish I could speak English.
I want to be a good father.
This is odd.
I hope he'll wait for me.
The teacher is with the school principal.
Are you a Japanese student?
It was really cheap.
Fire is always dangerous.
Mary declined an invitation to the concert.
She smiled and said goodbye.
"Hi, how's it going?"
Her hair style makes her look younger than her age.
Don't you see Tom?
Tom loves listening to classical music.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
We were late as a result of the traffic jam.
Tom applied for a scholarship.
Did you follow any of that?
Tom has a butler.
We'll be happy.
You are always complaining.
The text needs to be translated into Belarusian.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
I looked away.
Don't talk!
All Tom wanted was some peace and quiet.
I think we have some unfinished business.
Let's try!
I don't feel like going out.
Tom doesn't like to be touched.
Tom has been told not to try to do that by himself.
I'm not leaving until you tell me what I want to know.
I'd like to know what you think.
European currencies weakened against the dollar.
This is a good place to pitch our tent.
He became financially independent.
Stop playing with that.
How old are your children now?
This matter is of great importance.
I hope I can do this.
This is the most beautiful lake that I have ever seen.
She went home.
That's it. I've done everything I can do.
This aroused her suspicion.
Would you like to go out and get something to eat?
They left before the end of the movie.
I wish I was dead.
It turned out to be true.
Tom shouldn't have said those things.
Put your hands up!
Tom was arrested on drug-trafficking charges.
The train got in on time.
I can't explain it either.
May I turn off the light?
Now you're safe.
I don't know how to put it in Japanese.
"Could you turn that down, please?"
He wished he had more time.
I can come home early if you want me to.
I hope nothing's been broken.
Where can I buy a brush?
I found the keys.
I don't have as much money as you think.
It's very boring.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
Are you all right?
That was the first time I had ever driven a car.
He turned on the radio.
"They survived, even though the building was destroyed."
It's only a ten-minute walk.
It's not a joke.
"When I was a child, my mother would often read fairy tales to me."
The island is covered with ice and snow during the winter.
She participated in the beauty contest.
This compass will be useful on your trip.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
"After the rain, there were puddles on the street."
Jump!
Let me take a gander.
I really want to see you.
It doesn't matter.
They're all the same.
Is my answer correct?
Stay away from the door.
Tom is one of my friends.
I've been writing letters.
Tom left only a few minutes ago.
I went skiing with Tom.
I will take both this one and that one.
Have you been to London?
What time are you leaving?
I don't want to see Tom get hurt.
We haven't known each other long.
"More coffee, please."
Japan is one of the greatest economic powers in the world.
I'm not asking for your help.
She loves her children.
Tom came home early yesterday.
Thanks a bunch.
I got it.
Where did you stay?
My watch is five minutes fast.
Tom sat down and crossed his legs.
You're thin.
I also went.
Don't let me down.
Let me have a look.
I was a prison warden for ten years.
I don't know who painted this picture.
Tom didn't try to argue.
We have to keep working.
I'm sick of this.
Let me say goodbye to Tom.
Where is the station?
Let me check it.
He attributes his success to good luck.
We're having dinner right now.
Mary is Tom's sister-in-law.
Tomorrow's payday.
Iceland has many volcanoes.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
You will save yourself a lot of time if you take the car.
We compared his work with hers.
Did your wish come true?
I know that you still think about me.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
She asked him to help her father clean the garage.
I owe you a lot.
What if Tom finds out?
Don't make noise. Keep quiet.
I want to invite you to a party.
What are you looking for?
Tom obviously got what he came for.
Don't mock me.
Tom dreamed about Mary.
She is aggressive.
Do you want something to eat?
Tom won't hurt you.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Let's just hope Tom is alone.
Don't go yet.
This orange is delicious.
Hurry!
I'm from Singapore.
I bumped into your dad yesterday.
What are you talking about?
Take care of yourself.
We're credible.
"We have more music coming up, so stay tuned."
We only have three hours.
Tom saw Mary break the window.
Tom is still not answering his phone.
I ran into an old friend.
What're you two doing?
I want orange juice.
I read the label.
Does she know you?
"Tom looks tired, doesn't he?"
Tom said he'd pay for the entire thing.
Did you see something?
He made an important scientific discovery.
I'm serious.
"As a result of the blow, he became insane."
All the flights to Boston have been canceled.
I'm feeling tired.
Keep away from me.
He beat the dog with a stick.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I can come tomorrow.
Tom is fun.
They're still young.
Where did you take your glasses off?
Tom was shot and killed.
Please don't make fun of me.
We don't have much.
What are you going to do?
They were waiting for Tom.
Tom is a self-educated man.
Let's do it again.
He was jealous of their happiness.
French is their mother tongue.
Tom got home after midnight.
Do you want to go with me or do you prefer I call you a taxi?
How did you know Tom was going to be fired?
"Hello, Tom."
I don't want you to quit.
Tom told me about it.
"Hopefully, nobody protests."
"Give me the bill, please."
I can't say that.
Do you know who stole Tom's laptop?
Tom waited on the front porch for Mary.
Tom grows rice.
I heard that they discovered the footprints of an abominable snowman in the Himalayan mountains.
Keep an eye on the bags.
The dog is jumping.
I used to dream about being a millionaire.
I'm not what I used to be.
I'm playing a TV game.
"A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert."
He knows the truth.
I'd like to check out.
We must act at once.
Smoking is bad for you.
Grab Tom.
This is my friend.
Tom has been putting aside a little money each month.
He's a cold person like that.
I have a twin sister.
I want to go to a hotel.
Tom needs to lose three or four kilos.
I don't think she is happy.
We had a very vigorous debate.
I need to go to the toilet.
Tom thought Mary seemed really happy.
Which way is the beach?
What were you doing at that particular moment?
"When he got to the station, the train had already left."
I don't care if it snows.
Your problem is similar to mine.
Tom saw his name on the list.
Tom is useless.
When will you come back home?
She hasn't come yet.
Japanese companies generally provide their employees with uniforms.
It's a nice town.
Tom wasn't injured in the train wreck.
That isn't your decision.
We picked flowers in the garden.
Don't touch me.
At what time will you be leaving?
"If you're tired, why don't you go to sleep? ""Because if I go to sleep now I will wake up too early."""
May I use your phone?
It is under the chair.
He was afraid of his wife.
Could I please have one more can of beer?
"We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late."
He claimed that he had returned the book to the library.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
Which one is more expensive?
Don't let anything slow you down.
I tricked you.
Surfing looks like fun.
We must sleep at least eight hours a day.
That's your responsibility.
I'm tired of this monotonous life.
It's exactly as you say it is.
This isn't enough.
What will the neighbors say?
"Take hold of the rope, and I'll pull you up."
"OK, let's just do it."
The car crashed into the wall.
This is our chance to say thank you.
Tom couldn't hide his excitement.
Tom seemed to be worried about something.
No one wants that to happen.
"He did not go out, but sat down."
"You were a soldier during the war, right?"
Tom slammed the bathroom door shut.
The bridge is open to traffic.
You're so skinny.
It didn't just happen. We made it happen.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
The capital of France is Paris.
Can we talk later?
Many infected people don't even feel sick.
What is this?
This isn't fun.
Tom regretted quitting his job.
We should wait for help.
He asked us if we could draw a map of the United States.
The patient is steadily recovering.
Who's your favorite actor?
Tom probably just forgot you're here.
How late is the bank open?
Where are your things?
"Could I have one more coffee, please?"
The lakes are frozen.
I don't know either Tom or his brother.
Let's just do it.
"I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed."
Please tell the truth.
What should we focus on?
Our flight has been delayed.
"Tom sold his house for $300,000."
I'm here as a tourist.
Tom just wanted to be helpful.
Tom looked down at the floor.
Keep an eye on the baby for a while.
Where is the railroad station?
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Write on every other line.
Something's happening on Park Street.
Try to be generous and forgive.
Nobody understands.
"What's your major, Tom?"
Do you want something to drink?
Tom would never forgive us if we did that.
Do you want to pay with a credit card?
Have you lost your mind?
What's your favorite winter food?
I was very hungry.
Tom came to dislike Mary.
Would you say it once more?
Drivers should be aware of the traffic rules.
I'm thinking about changing my supplier.
We must pay attention to traffic signals.
That's curious.
Do what you think is right.
I can't approve the project. It leaves much to be desired.
I didn't know you had hay fever.
They're not illegal.
Are you certain about that?
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I can't help you now.
It's my only hope.
We often see Tom.
Tom rode his bicycle to school.
The audience appeared bored.
Human remains were found during the excavation.
Tom asked us to be silent.
I generally have lunch there.
My mother is a lawyer.
Can you slow down a little?
Not everything can be explained.
It was clear.
His bag was stolen yesterday.
I'm going to the restroom.
What's the best way to do that?
That's odd.
Where will you go for the vacation?
It seems you were right.
The sun is going down.
He is an actor.
Can you see it?
It's not enough.
"That may mean nothing to you, but it means a lot to me."
They're kind of fun.
"You can lie to everyone else, but you can't lie to yourself."
You're interfering.
This room is not very large.
I'm a person.
I think we need to find a new babysitter.
I'll lend you this book.
I feel really tired.
What time does boarding begin?
I didn't know this.
He was satisfied with the result.
I have a stepbrother.
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
When did you start wearing contacts?
Tom could've been killed.
Is there a knife in the kitchen?
Where does your uncle live?
Tom asked Mary to stop working.
She can speak not only English but also French.
Do you know any restaurants with good Korean food?
I want you to read this book.
What're you drinking?
I need to get a stamp.
"You don't really believe that, do you?"
I like white wine better than red.
I was away for a while.
She has tried various methods of slimming down.
Children were running to and fro in the park.
Tom decided to try sleeping without a pillow.
That girl over there is my sister.
We've got major problems.
Who in the world do you think you are?
He didn't dare say anything.
We'd better do what they ask.
Freeze!
Tom certainly wasn't at home when we went to visit him.
When will you return home?
Tom is trying not to cry.
Please open the window.
You should apologize to your father for not getting home in time for dinner.
I went out for a walk.
I'd like to thank Tom for all he's done.
I have to cook the vegetables.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
The candle went out by itself.
Meetings are held every other week.
Tom thinks he knows everything.
I wear glasses.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
Rejection hurts.
I should have taken the money.
You should be proud of me.
I guess it sounds a bit silly.
We hope you can help us.
Don't forget to send that letter.
It wasn't funny.
When does the movie start?
I don't need it anymore.
When can we eat?
Tom must be lonely.
What is the price?
How did this effect you?
It turned out to be true.
Who was it that bought this skirt yesterday?
Aren't you being very rude?
Mary always assists her boyfriend in doing his assignments.
Where did you get this key?
He married a girl of his own choice.
We waste a lot of time.
Where's the train station?
Tom put on my shirt.
I like white roses better than red ones.
Thank you for your beautiful postcard.
He has a good head on his shoulders.
I ate three pieces of cake.
I'm thinking about you.
Tom was raised in a small village.
I'd be happy to work with you.
I'm kidding.
I admire your courage.
I believe in you.
The wine was excellent.
I am tired of my monotonous life.
"Maybe that's what Tom would do, but I wouldn't do that."
My back still hurts.
Tom probably won't become famous.
It was good working with you.
I don't think anything changes.
Nobody asked you.
He did not have much time to work on his speech.
Tom is reading a history book.
"If my house were a mansion, I would invite everyone I know to my birthday party."
We ran down the hill.
It's natural for him to get angry.
Don't worry about me.
I don't even have a boyfriend.
What would you like to drink?
I knew he would accept.
I can't put up with this any longer.
I don't care what happens.
"I should ask, shouldn't I?"
"If I were to tell him the truth, he would be angry."
This has been good.
Let's not talk about it any more.
Stick a stamp on the envelope.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
My brother swims well.
He's the head of the marketing department.
At what time will you be leaving?
Would you care to try?
Why is she here?
She is as beautiful as her mother.
Admission to the museum is thirty dollars.
A customs declaration is required.
Let's do it.
What's your marital status?
Please tell the truth.
"Mary has nobody to talk with, but she doesn't feel lonely."
I will not tolerate this.
Don't you remember the question?
"When his wife died, he received dozens of letters of sympathy."
What's your favorite kind of candy?
When did the accident take place?
They are not at all interested.
Let's approach the problem from a different angle.
"I went, too."
No one was more surprised than Tom.
I was at a movie theater.
Tom is on good terms with John.
A promise is a promise.
He isn't here yet.
Tom sometimes comes home late.
"First think, and then speak."
Please stop that.
You treated me like a little kid.
What made you come here?
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
It's not enough.
They are actors.
"OK, you win."
May I borrow your knife?
Tom isn't a bad father.
How can copyright laws be enforced?
He is on the point of leaving for Canada.
Have you already eaten?
There was nothing I could do about it.
We have two television sets.
He took a chance investing his money in the new company.
The United States borders Canada.
The actor died at the height of his popularity.
I saw her sweep the room.
This is one of my favorite books.
What a bore!
My French teacher is the same age as I am.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
I still haven't learned to drive a car.
It may rain.
The bridge had been built before that time.
How do you do?
He is a teacher and novelist.
Tom began to cry loudly.
My brother is always acting foolishly.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
She always smiles.
I expand my knowledge by reading books.
I don't want to go alone.
Can't a woman have a dream?
I can't read your mind.
I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
"Tom is lying in bed, asleep."
Tom won't let you go.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
Will you stay here for a while?
Tom made a kite.
That's nonsense.
I must've made a mistake.
The hunter shot a bear.
Please show me your driver's license.
I've never seen the sea.
I didn't even know that you knew how to speak French.
"If Tom had seen anything, he would have told us."
This is the last straw!
What do you have in your bag?
I'm grateful to you.
You must tighten the knot.
Did you leave a tip?
I don't know for certain when he'll come back.
Let's give it a shot.
Tom never even left the house.
Tom likes to listen to Mary sing.
I don't think he is truthful.
He had the courage to decline the offer.
She went inside.
Tom is exactly the same age as you.
I'm proud of you.
"Eventually, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself."
How often do the buses come?
She was chosen from ten thousand applicants.
Would you rather be fat and ugly or thin and sexy?
Some of the money was stolen.
I caught a cold last month.
I'm playing football now.
That's very easy to do.
Let me think it over for a couple of days.
I'll lend you my notebook.
It's probably going to be hard for Tom to do that.
Do your children have their own rooms?
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
The trouble is that I have no money with me.
I need someone to talk to.
My father insisted I should go to see the place.
What does USSR stand for?
This has all happened before.
I like watermelon.
She stayed at the hotel for several days.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I can't play it from memory. Please give me the music.
What does the Bible say about this?
I studied really hard in order to pass the exam.
Tom promised not to go out after dark alone.
You're always complaining about your husband.
We've known each other for ages.
They eat dinner at twelve o'clock.
Do you know this comic?
Are you sure you heard something?
I wasn't married when we first met.
When are you coming home?
"If you turn here, you can probably avoid a lot of traffic."
I can't pronounce that name.
Tom wanted another piece of watermelon.
What should we focus on?
A number of people die in traffic accidents.
I had no idea where I should go.
I'm happy to be here.
"Tom was late for class, as is often the case."
Tom doesn't know how much it'll cost.
Don't say that.
Millions of men lost their jobs.
Tom looks perplexed.
Some animals eat their young.
Tom is an amateur photographer.
We took the enemy by surprise.
Please tell me your address.
We've had a difficult schedule.
I don't think he is truthful.
Tom is not famous.
Thank you for giving me the option.
All you have to do is to tell the truth.
What's your favorite sport?
We watched a baseball game on television.
They're very cheerful people.
I've changed my website's layout.
City officials often have sticky fingers.
Tom likes fried chicken.
Don't touch my car.
It's not a cat. It's a dog.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I'm a realistic person.
I meet with him once every six months.
How much fabric did you buy?
There is an exception to every rule.
Do you understand her?
Be still.
Everyone stared at me.
Tom's gym teacher is Mary's basketball coach.
"Fill it with regular, please."
Do you know who they are?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Why are we going to Boston?
"In Japan, we drive on the left side of the road."
I'm trying to memorize the names of constellations.
Everybody knows them.
Who would want to live in a place like this?
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
Work as hard as you can.
Tom has big hands.
Tom always makes me laugh.
I thank you very much for your help.
I'm interested in oriental pottery.
Are you in love?
Put on your coat.
Has Tom said anything?
I thought you might feel the same way.
I'm not a tourist.
"If you see her from a distance, she is beautiful."
He held his tongue and didn't say a word.
I want to change the world.
This is good sushi.
I have three cameras.
This is big.
"Come on, let's do it."
That's great!
Apples are scarce this year.
I have to pay a little more attention.
There are a lot of children in the park.
We had a chat for a while.
Public opinion began to change.
Is everything all right?
Your work is below average.
How did you get hurt?
Please take your seat.
Do you have a pen?
We're a little worried about Tom.
What did you do on the weekend?
Is this accurate?
Tom is in the attic.
Eggs are getting more expensive.
I'll help you move to your new house.
She is eight.
What's this?
Don't fight.
Where's the newspaper?
Who will look after the baby?
"For children up to 5 years old, family breakdown can be difficult to understand."
Do you have any questions?
I have life insurance.
That's not an answer.
We've done the impossible.
I had no one to turn to.
"We can't see ultraviolet light, but insects can."
I don't want to do this with you.
Please hurry!
My father works in a factory.
He scarcely ever watches TV.
I'm sure I won't be disappointed.
"This soup is really delicious, isn't it?"
How often do you eat out?
Tom is alone in the living room.
What size shoes do you wear?
I am busy cooking at the moment.
That's pretty cool.
You did an excellent job.
Tom probably doesn't know Mary's phone number.
You should sleep.
What could I say?
